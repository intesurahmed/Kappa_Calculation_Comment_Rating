The reality was more prosaic. The odour, variously described as cabbage, rotten eggs or diesel, came from a leak of a harmless – if undeniably smelly – gas at a chemical works in the northern French city of Rouen. After much nose-holding and occasional reports of nausea and headaches around Rouen and Paris, about 70 miles away, the cloud was blown across the channel into Kent and Sussex, and then to the south-east of London.

Its arrival on British shores brought a flurry of calls to local police and the National Grid's gas emergency line, with the latter reporting 60,000 calls by 10am on Tuesday, as against a normal daily total of 10,000. Official reassurance often came via Facebook and Twitter, with Hastings police using the self-explanatory #noneedtopanic hashtag.

Alarm was, inevitably, replaced on social media by a welter of flatulence jokes and jibes at neighbouring towns accused of always smelling that way. Before too long the semi-official term Le Pong emerged, seemingly coined by a Portsmouth newspaper.

The gas was mercaptan, also known as methanethiol, a naturally occurring substance used as an additive in the chemicals industry and in animal feeds. Testament to its odour comes in the fact the substance is not only closely related to the smell in a skunk's spray but plays a key part in the aromas of halitosis and flatulence.

It began leaking on Monday morning from the Lubrizol plant in Rouen, a company belonging to the US business magnate Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway empire. As the cloud drifted to Paris, the fire service and interior ministry had to ask people to stop ringing clogged emergency phone numbers. Paris police had their own take on the smell, describing it vividly as a combination of ""sweat, garlic and rotten eggs"".

The French ministry of the interior said the gas was of a very smelly type similar to that added to town gas to give it an odour. ""It doesn't present any health risk,"" said the ministry.

However, in such a strong concentrations the gas could prove toxic, according to INRS, the French National Institute for Research and Security and the Prevention of Work Accidents.

Delphine Batho, the French ecology minister, in Berlin for the 50th anniversary celebrations of the signing of the Elysée Treaty between France and Germany, cut short her visit to fly to Rouen on Tuesday afternoon.

The French Cup match between Olympique Marseilles and Rouen was cancelled.

""We don't want to find ourselves with 10,000 spectators just two kilometers from the factory without any way of keeping them in or evacuating them if necessary,"" Florence Gouache, director of the local prefect's office, told Le Nouvel Observateur.

The emergency services were reported to have received around 10,000 calls in Paris alone.

Overnight the gas drifted across the Channel, bringing as much confusion as outright panic. ""I could definitely smell burning. We thought something must be on fire,"" Keri Bond, manager of the Champneys spa in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, told the BBC. ""We were going into every room and smelling it to see if there was a fire. It smelled like burning or as if the air conditioning system had broken down.""

The calls to emergency services began, with the London fire brigade reporting 25 connected to the gas before 10.30am. While some fire services advised people to close doors and windows – arguably good advice anyway during a cold snap in January – the Health Protection Agency said the aroma would cause nothing worse than mild nausea and should naturally disperse.

Back in Rouen, Lubrizol staff were struggling to stop the leak on Tuesday, with the smell still sufficiently strong to prompt the cancellation of a French Cup tie between third-division Rouen, whose stadium is near the factory, and Olympique de Marseille.

""It's not so much a leak as a product that has decomposed, which smells very bad and which is escaping,"" Pierre-Jean Payrouse of Lubrizol told RTL radio. ""An investigation is under way but our priority is to deal with the problem.""

Some French people remained sceptical about the safety assurances. ""Everyone says there's nothing to panic about,"" one woman, Patricia Cousteau, was quoted as saying in the Paris Normandie newspaper. ""But they said the same thing about the Chernobyl cloud.""",https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jan/22/french-gas-cloud-stink-south-east#comments," Rather a nasty niff around Brighton today - I'd assumed there was someone with particularly bad body odour in the office, but it was outside as well.

For people directly exposed to the gas it can lead to lung problems, dizziness, nausea and neurlogical illness according to the French Institute for Research and Security (INRS).

Reports of sightings of a beast with a mane like Aslan prowling in a wheatfield behind the Leisure Glade caravan park just before 7pm on Sunday evening sparked a huge police operation. It involved armed officers, a helicopter with an infrared camera, and zoological experts toting tranquilliser guns. Rumour flowed. One eyewitness said the beast had no mane; another local heard ""a loud roar at 10pm"". The internet buzzed with unverifiable images of a big cat at night, eyes gleaming.

""It has caused a bit of a stir in the village,"" said Jimmy Green, from St Osyth, near where the animal was spotted. ""My wife didn't want to let our dog out.""

Just 19 hours later the giddy hunt was over and the police declared there was no evidence of a lion after all. What it was remains unclear, but pictures seem to point to a wildcat or large domestic cat rather than an escaped lion from a circus or a gangster's illicit menagerie.

In an operation that locals described as ""surreal"" and akin to a murder manhunt, Essex police scrambled on Sunday night to scour the land around Earls Hall Drive near Clacton, telling residents nearby to stay indoors.

""Public safety is our priority which is why we are taking the sighting and all associated evidence seriously,"" said a spokesman. On Monday morning officers were back to search for paw prints and warned that ""away from towns everyone should be aware of the possible risk"".

The first sighting was made by Denise Martin, 52, a warehouse worker from Canvey Island staying at the Earls Hall Farm caravan site.

""I was looking out of the window and we saw smoke – it looked like there had been a bit of a bonfire,"" she said. ""When the smoke cleared I could see this shape in the field, so I got the binoculars out. We had a look and it looked like a lion.

""I said to my husband: 'What do you make of that?' He said: 'That's a lion.'""

She said it was tan coloured with a white chest and her husband called the police.

""We weren't scared at all – it was excitement. You don't often see something like that in the wild. One time it sat up and looked at us and we could see its ears twitching. It knew we were there and it sat down and started cleaning itself.""

Across the caravan park Gill and Steve Atkin were watching Come Dine With Me when they first saw the big cat in the field around 150 metres away.

""Steve was outside and came back to the caravan saying: 'Look at this, bring your binoculars and a camera',"" said Gill Atkin, 51, from Louth in Lincolnshire. ""Then one of our neighbours came running across to us. We thought someone was ill the way he looked so worried. He wanted us to confirm what he was seeing to the police."" Mr Atkin said he told the police: ""Christ, we have a lion here or a tiger. It's definitely a large cat.""

Before long a police helicopter was in the sky above the farm and for 20 minutes he guided the police helicopter controller over the fields, before the cat, ""about the size of two sheep"", moved on. Their pictures show a grey-tinged animal with pointy ears and a whiteish collar.

His wife was less sure it was a lion, but she never mentioned her doubts to the police. ""It was lying in the grass, rolling and sitting up and looking at us,"" she said. ""I thought it was more sphinx-like than a lion."" The Atkins only supplied their pictures to the police on Monday afternoon, not long before the search was called off by the authorities.

""We believe what was seen was either a large domestic cat or a wildcat,"" a police spokesman said in a final statement. ""Extensive searches have been carried out, areas examined and witnesses spoken to, yet nothing has been found to suggest that a lion was in the area.""

Sarah Forsyth, a curator at Colchester zoo who was called to assist police investigate the sighting, said the pictures of the animal were of ""very poor quality"" but the police had had to act as they were unable to say they definitely did not show a lion.

Forsyth said she and colleague Anthony Tropeano, the zoological director, arrived in St Osyth with tranquilliser equipment. ""By the time we got there whatever it was had gone. We were shown some photographs, but they were from very far away, very poor quality and to be honest there was no way of saying yes or no.""

The big cat hunt had developed into a circus. The man from the Mirror was dressed up in a safari outfit and wielded a tin of cat food, while a resident, John Jupp, passed the time by jokingly duping a reporter from Russian television into thinking a picture of a tiger in a zoo on his iPhone was the beast of Essex.

Online the public embraced the classic bank holiday story. Twitter accounts were set up purporting to document the movements of the ""Essex lion"" and several doctored photographs were circulated on social networking sites.

Eddie Bowley, who set up the @EssexLion account and had amassed nearly 40,000 followers by Monday evening, said the process had been ""a bizarre experience"": ""I had Mario Falcone from TOWIE [The Only Way is Essex] call me sad, Imogen Thomas ask me out for lunch and Philip Schofield telling me to hand myself in,"" he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/27/essex-lion-hunt-bank-holiday#comments," Oh come on, it's about time someone stopped lion about this situation and swallowed their pride!", It's either an extremely small lion that looks exactly like an average-sized domestic cat or it's an average-sized domestic cat.," I was coming out of a shop in Clacton  and there were a crowd of people running up the street. I stopped a bloke and asked ""what's up?"" ""A lion has escaped from the zoo"" he replied. I asked "" Which way did it go?"" ""Well,"" he replied "" We ain't fucking chasing it."""," I see the concept of scale has yet to reach the denizens of Essex. ""Must be a lion, it was almost twice as tall as a blade of grass"""," Yeah, I think it's a corgi too.. A fox at best.. What really worries me about that picture though is the giant Woolly Mammoth I can see lurking in the trees that no one else seems to have noticed.", The picture is cat shaped but I think people have failed to learn the lesson Farther Ted tries to teach Dougal... small vs far away," Have been laughing myself silly today over this story.  Lions do not have white ""bibs"" on their chests. There is no sign of a mane, so is it perhaps a lioness? Imho, it looks like a large Corgi!"," ........""It was lying in the grass, rolling and sitting up and looking at us,"" she said. ""I thought it was more sphinx-like than a lion.""......... Sphinx-like? In Greek tradition, it has the haunches of a lion, the wings of a great bird, and the face of a woman - Curiouser and curiouser, did someone spike the water in Clacton over the weekend?"," The sun has gone to people's heads...the photo looks like a cat. I do wonder what it was the couple on the news think they saw, but I really think people want to pep up their moribund lives - this theory is substantiated by the fact that there was a cougar sighting the very same day..", It's a corgi or a ginger tom ffs!! I can't believe the police got involved in this........," ""Dad, there's a man with a bill at the door"" ""Impossible son, must be a duck wearing a hat""", Does this lion run towards the sound of a tin being hit with a fork and answer to the name of Tiddles?," It seems bizarre that anyone could look at this photo and see a lion. It looks like it is, a ginger tabby sitting in a field of stubble. In fact this is the clue to scale in the photograph that most people are missing. The cat is partly out of site in relative short stubble. It could not have partly concealed a much larger animal like this. Whilst it was useful that the pair from Colchester zoo clarified the misleading impression given by the police, it nevertheless must be understood that just because someone works in a zoo does not necessarily make them an experienced field naturalist - they might be, but it is not a qualification required for the job. This last part is very important. You see field natural history and biology is somewhat different than the type of thing zoo or lab based zoologists are used to. The difference is primarily that those who are used to zoo animals etc, are used to working close-up and directly with animals. However, the field worker often doesn't even directly see the things they study, so they are far more used to interpreting indirect or less distinct evidence. I'm aware I'm taking a more po-faced angle on this, but this is just because I'm a naturalist, and naturalists tend to take wildlife more seriously. However, you can all have a good laugh at this, because it's all about ""jizz"". Accept in this case it's a birdwatching term for identifying something at a distance from general appearance and behaviour, when it is too far to see critical detail. Although if you just put jizz in a search engine you will obviously come up with a lot of porn. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jizz_%28birding%29 The point I'm making is that experienced field naturalists, whether amateurs or professionals, are used to identifying things at a distance from indistinct detail. This is why I'm slightly surprised that the pair from Colchester zoo did not immediately offer the opinion that it looked like a ginger tabby. But then, just because they work in a zoo, does not mean that they have much, or any experience of interpreting what a species is from fuzzy distant detail. It's also important the police understand the distinction. Because whilst zoo staff are some of the most appropriately experienced people to tranquilise and capture an animal, they are not necessarily the most qualified or experienced in either finding animals in the wild, interpreting indirect signs, or interepreting fuzzy distant images.", Tie Osbourne to a lamppost as bait., It what universe is that a bloody lion?

As the political row continued over the chancellor's decision to scrap the 50% income tax band, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said the impact of the decision was ""uncertain"" and the overall package could result in a bigger giveaway than the Treasury had intended.

Paul Johnson, the thinktank's director, said: ""We know pretty much that the increase in the personal allowance will cost about £3.5bn in 2014-15. We do not know with anything like such certainty that the cut in the 50% rate will only cost £100m. We do not know that the proposed caps on tax relief will bring in the £300m or so the chancellor is banking on. Nor do we know that the stamp duty changes will raise the nearly £300m that he has pencilled in. The budget may turn out to be less fiscally neutral than intended.""

Since the 2010 election, Osborne has made a priority of reassuring the financial markets about the coalition government's commitment to cutting Britain's record peacetime budget deficit, but the IFS said he had created ""some risks"" with his latest package.

Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, seized on the IFS comments. ""George Osborne has taken a potentially hugely expensive gamble. By giving a £3bn tax cut to the very richest – an average tax cut of £10,000 to every top rate taxpayer – he is betting that he will somehow get £2.9bn back in extra tax revenues from people currently not paying the top rate of tax.

Earlier, Osborne insisted that the 50% tax band was not bringing in the revenues predicted by the last Labour government and that the biggest winners from his budget were working people on low and middle incomes.

""What we have tried to do is to spread the burden of the fiscal consolidation – dealing with the nation's debts – as fairly as possible. The biggest weight has gone on the richest 1%,"" he said. ""I have seen attempts to bash the rich, like the 50p rate, that completely failed. Rich people went around boasting that they were paying lower tax rates than their cleaners – so it was a tax con.""

In its post-budget analysis, the IFS said further big cuts in welfare and spending by Whitehall departments were looming in the next parliament as the chancellor sought to meet his tough targets for cutting the deficit. The thinktank said that if departmental cuts continued at their same pace for two years after the 2015 election, a further £8bn – 7.5% – would have to be taken out of the welfare budget.

The IFS also highlighted the risk that more and more key voters in middle Britain would be paying higher rates of tax by the time of the next election because of the decision to freeze the threshold at which individuals pay 40% income tax at £41,450 from April 2013. Johnson said that would lead to a ""significant"" increase of 325,000 in the number of workers paying the higher rate next year.

""Put that together with the freeze in the basic rate limit and fiscal drag more generally and the number of higher-rate payers could increase from 3.7 million to five million by 2014,"" he added. ""This is part of a long-term trend towards the encroachment of 40% income tax on to people earning above-average but relatively modest salaries.

""It would be useful to know if the chancellor has a view as to what proportion of taxpayers should be paying at the higher rate. It will reach 15% next year, having been just 5% in the late 1980s."" The IFS said that its own estimate of the top rate of income tax that would maximise revenues was in line with the new 45% rate announced by Osborne in the budget, but it said there was great uncertainty about the impact of the change.

""The truth is that we still do not know the true effect of the 50% tax rate on revenues. The worry for the chancellor is that the estimate that cutting the top rate to 45% will only cost £100m is particularly uncertain"", Johnson said.

""Even if we knew the effect of introducing the 50% rate – which we don't with any precision – responses may not be symmetric. Those who got a taste for avoiding the 50% rate may continue to avoid the 45% rate, even if they wouldn't have done so had the 50% rate never existed. The experiment with the 50% rate does not appear to have gone well.""

While Balls said 4½ million pensioners would lose £83 a year as a result of Osborne's move to phase out the additional income tax personal allowance for pensioners, Johnson said the so-called ""granny tax"" was a ""relatively modest tax increase on a group hitherto well sheltered from tax and benefit changes.""

The IFS director was strongly critical of the proposed increase in stamp duty on the sale of homes worth more than £2m. He said: ""Despite the range of changes it is hard to see this as the budget of a truly tax reforming chancellor. The hotch potch of reforms bears as many marks of political expediency as it does of strategic reform.""",https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/mar/22/budget-ifs-doubt-osborne-arithmetic#comments, He was born with that name and changed it to George.

The convenient fallacy of omission is shown up when we see that the incomes of this wealthiest bracket have risen to fourteen times as much in real terms over the same period. Insult to injury is added if any kind of calculation is made considering the rise in flat rate taxes and service charges over the period, costing the poorest strata significantly more as a percentage of income.", Please help this millionaire hoard more money offshore.....please donate a poor -pensioners-pension.... and together we can make pensioners history !!," Its very logical if you think about it!

Forgive me, on an income of approximately £1Million having avoided approximately £500,000 tax by dubious if legal means they will now be delighted to pay £450,000 instead of zero? Course they will. Remember people like Philip Green, BHS, Topshop et al, avoided hundreds of millions in tax avoidance schemes by paying his wife special dividends in Monacco, yes, before the 50p rate was even thought of. I believe this was achieved by borrowing huge sums of cash from the banks against future profits in BHS and Arcadia.

It clearly demonstrates their comment comes from a tribal background."," I have posted this comment on a few threads today and I am sorry to be boring and tedious and keep going over the same old things but..... Because there were no changes to the top rate of income tax between 1988 and 2010 there are no more recent estimates of the impact of top tax changes on revenue in the UK on which to draw. However, there is some evidence from the one-off payroll tax on bankers’ bonuses which was introduced in the 2009 Pre-Budget Report. This tax imposed a 50% tax on any bonus paid by a bank to an employee of more than £25,000. The original Treasury estimate from the 2009 Pre-Budget Report was that the bonus tax would raise £550 million. However, based on actual data on bonuses being paid in the 2009-10 tax year, the estimates of the yield from the bonus tax were revised upwards to £1.3 billion in the 2010 Budget – more than double the original estimate. In other words, the Treasury – presumably using a methodology similar to the one used for its estimate of the revenue impact of the 50p income tax rate – vastly underestimated the revenue yield from the bonus tax. It therefore seems reasonable to infer that yields from the 50% tax rate will also be larger than the Treasury estimates, if anything. Moreover, in many ways the one-off bonus tax is a lot easier to avoid than the 50% rate, assuming that the 50% rate stays in place for a number of years. Banks could have chosen to defer bonuses until the following year, for example. So the high yield from the bonus tax is strong (if indirect) evidence that yields from the 50% rate will exceed Treasury expectations. i think it is very relevant as quite simply they make it up as they go along."," Because being old is hard enough.I don't have any problem at all with my elderly parents getting an extra £1000 pa tax allowance.I really don't see what the big deal is.

One good thing is though, that my dad has now learned the error of his ways, he voted tory for the first time last election.... he was up in arms yesterday (the air as well as his face were turning blue!) and he called the tories all the lying, cheating, theiving scum on the planet.... lesson learned!!!"," Seeing as none of this was in anyone’s manifesto and no one won the election outright I say they have no mandate for it. We need a new government before they do anymore damage. We should be demanding this now as we need to bring them down before the wreck anything else. We need to bring them down before they bring in Chinese privateers to run Liverpool, before the roads are owned by French multinationals. Kick them out before they sell our schools to Murdoch without consultation (look at what the education wing of New International are up to; they are after our schools.) boot them out before they destroy the NHS with their Thatcher on steroids reforms. Bring them down before they get rid of benefits for my disabled mum, Boot them from office before they start paying wages by post-code, (and benefits too), tell them enough is enough as they give billions more away to themselves, while not paying taxes on their income for another year (Sir Phillip Green you owe us 250 million, paying no tax on your income is morally corrupt). Hound them for robbing our pensions to pay their friends bonuses; disabuse them for closing down almost any decent service in local government; abuse them for cutting benefits to the poorest while paying themselves billions in tax breaks, hound them for throwing disabled Remploy workers to the dogs of the dole. refude to be ruled by the robbers of you and your children's pensions. Refuse to accept their robbing of your children's higher education. These people hate you and your family. Don't let them do any more damage. This government can't believe their luck and its about time we threw them out before they sell all the family silver to themselves at rock bottom prices. The government needs our consent to do these things. I for one withdraw my consent and so should you. The last people to bring down a weak government with no support were the miners in 1972. We must repeat their example before it’s all too late. General strike at the Olympics!", It always was the footsoldiers who took the kicking. Pensioneers will also losincome from the change to CPI. Next winter how many more will die from hypothermia as the really poor pensioneers' incomes are squeezed. Gideon- Osborne's real name- means Destroyer. Totally apt," This is a budget which aims to damage the two ends of the age spectrum... particularly when viewed against the other measures. Children are losing out in so many ways... - child benefits - child tax credits - education cuts - EMA - tuition fees So the way forward to solving the long term fiscal headache is to discourage responsible people from having children? If the birth rate drops 'cos nobody can afford to bring them up then the issues of too many pensioners per working age person will become much worse over time.  Great policy Gideon. Labout encouraged RESPONSIBLE people to have children through tax incentives - a policy for the next generations.  Not political opportunism and short-termism. My children will end up: - working longer - paying more - privatised healthcare (or a poor second class citizen service) - random education based on idiology that is at best incomprehensible, at worse socially divisive. Oh and as they currently live 'oop north' they will receive less wage for doing the same job as somebody paying the same price for milk at Tesco Pensioners are getting income stealthily removed from here, there and everywhere... many will die as they will be too poor to heat their homes and won't receive the care they need. And who do I blame?  I blame Nick.  He chose to take his party into this and will reap the dividends as millions switch votes from a heartless party with a feckless leader to one of the others... or more probably stay home ushering another five years of this lot! (Sighs loudly, bangs head on keyboard)"," Although he has reduced the highest tax rate, Osborne has not changed the threshold at which it operates. With the higher earners seemingly exempt from curbs on pay increases, how many more will be in what will become the 45% tax group?  How many of these will actually pay? It seems to me that when salaries reach higher levels the incentives to avoid tax are always great, irrespective of the tax rate. Would a better way, of collecting tax for higher earners, be to target the outgoings of the companies who pay the salaries?"," You'd best e-mail them, bet they'd love it..", What's this tribal shit supposed to convey?, Funny how you responded then., I might be just as desperate for a laugh as you are.," Gordon Brown was framed by systemic failure, you know, complete financial insolvency, you must have noticed.

The easiest way to understand it, and I got this from professor Brian Cox, is to think of two theoretical cars.  One is a Fiat Panda, the other a BMW, both are sealed and full of Think; quite clearly the BMW would win in a race even though it had more Think in it. Don’t get this confused with a thinking Tank, that’s a Dalek which is a thinly veiled metaphor for fascism- the Cybermen being the Communists obviously. Like I have said, if you are a leading Think-Tank you probably drive a better car than a slower Think-Tank. Hope that helps.", The IFS analysis on the 50% rate proves Osborne was lying and that this same rate should have been shored up with more effective measures to prevent tax avoidance.   That way a cleaner may end up paying far lower rates of tax than the people using the toilets.

If the tax rate go up 5% they award themselves 20% and then claim they are paying a lot more tax. Obviously, that's just mirrors and bits of string to make it look like they're paying more tax. Certainly, none of them are going to paying more tax if the rate is lowered, as many commentators have already pointed out. They're just going to take the money and run. The only way to stop the rich siphoning off the world's wealth, while claiming the rest of us are living off their backs, is to stop the free flow of money to and from fiscal paradises. Yes, they can take it out, but they have to spend it there, not try to bring it back.

Sounds good to me. We have to get away from this fantasy that the very rich can pay for everything. They can't, there aren't enough of them. If we want to properly fund our spending the bulk of the money is inevitably going to come from those who earn above average but not huge incomes, because there are a lot of these people.", Loved this bit in particular: Tax avoidance is morally repugnant and we will come down on like a ton of bricks! . . . Don't worry everyone! We estimate that the revenue generated from our clamp down on tax avoidance will more than compensate for that lost from the cut in the 50p tax rate!

Rich people went around boasting that they were paying lower tax rates than their cleaners – so it was a tax con."" Another disingenuous quote from George. If the person was paying less in tax than their cleaner, that suggests that it wasn't anything to do with the 50p rate at all, more about how easy it is for rich people to shift their incomes for tax purposes. Cutting the 50p rate would do nothing to make this person pay more. And I'd definitely love to see a list of the tax liabilities of the Government.

As spring begins, and customers’ thoughts turn to bare ankles, the shops are full of culottes. For every budget, taste, and occasion, there is a pair. They might be denim with unfinished edges (Topshop) or tailored and navy and destined for the office (Marks & Spencer). In designer fashion, there are nautical versions with button-down fronts (JW Anderson) and voluminous creations in black leather (Tibi) while Stella McCartney’s are a vision in soft grey boucle.

In many ways, this is a weird trend, given that culottes have often been a sartorial punchline. Think of Eurovision 1974, and Agnetha Fältskog’s shiny blue pair, with calf-skimming tulip-shaped hems – an outfit so comical it has since become part of the fancy-dress vernacular. For anyone who went to Brownies in the 1990s, culottes were the flappy, conker-coloured shorts worn while sitting cross-legged on a dusty church hall floor feeling anything but cool.

But culottes are selling – lots and lots. At Whistles, between 1 January and 23 March, sales were up by 422% compared with the same period last year, with culottes outselling skirts. Marks & Spencer reports strong culotte sales, too, with a leather Autograph pair, hitting shops later this month, predicted to be one of the big sellers of the season.

Even those who are actually selling culottes have had their reservations. “I think culottes are not very flattering on most people, to be honest,” says Whistles chief executive Jane Shepherdson. “But ever since we first brought them in, about two years ago, they keep surprising us.

“They are so popular that we have been looking at some of the skirts in production and wondering if we should be joining them as culottes,” she adds. “I suppose it might be because they are quite an obvious trend – like a midi skirt – and they represent a change in the long-standing silhouette, from skinny bottoms and oversized tops, to the opposite.”

“I remember saying a couple of years ago, ‘I bloody hate culottes,’” says Justin O’Shea, buying director of luxury shopping website MyTheresa.com. “But I’ve come around to accepting the culotte. They seem to tie in with the way that fashion is heading, which is that women are dressing for themselves and each other and not to appeal to men. A woman who would wear culottes would probably be very fashion forward and not girly – that’s kind of the point of the design.”

Appropriately, Culottes have a feminist backstory. After their popularisation in 18th-century France (so closely were they associated with the ruling class that their opposers were known as “sans-culottes”) in Victorian England they were trousers in disguise – skirts that would split apart to enable women to ride horses, play tennis and ride bicycles.

As ever in fashion, much of the appeal lies in the fact that culottes feel unexpected and different to the mainstream – and as with any quirky clothing shape, styling can be tricky. A neat vest or T-shirt, either tucked in or short enough to show the waist, can be a helpful counterpoint to all that volume. Block heels, too, will make you feel a little taller, even if you don’t fancy tottering around in stilettos.

For some younger shoppers keen to buy into the trend, the answer might be showing some skin: “For summer,” says Asos womenswear design director Vanessa Spence, “we are offering matching jacquard bralets and culottes, which offers our customer a young, fun way to wear the culottes.” But for the power players who wear them while sitting in the front rows of fashion shows, the aim is to look kooky and cerebral rather than deliberately sexy. (See early adopter Victoria Beckham, who wore culottes to underline her high-end designer credentials at New York fashion week in September 2013.) In fashion circles, culottes are an alpha statement: either “I don’t care if this looks a bit weird because I like it” or “my legs are so thin that I can even wear these culottes”, depending on your levels of cynicism.",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/mar/24/culottes-spring-tricky-to-wear#comments, Pretty sure all these pics (apart from the tennis player) show weird trousers rather than culottes.

Fast-forward 21 years and it seems it is now another story for Naomi Campbell, Kate Moss, Elle Macpherson and Cindy Crawford, who have been pictured in fur coats, gilets and trimmed parkas.

They are not alone in falling off the anti-fur wagon. Figures from the International Fur Federation show that the industry is enjoying another year of considerable growth. The demand for mink, sable, fox and ferret has soared and farmers have stepped up production.

In 2013/14, 87.2m mink pelts were produced around the world, worth a total of £2.2bn, with 35m produced by China alone.

China also remains one of the biggest producers of fox pelt, and together with Finland was responsible for 91% of the 7.8m fox furs produced globally.

The figures – the first to show a breakdown of different pelts – follow on from research by the IFF last year which valued the global fur trade at more than £26bn.

On the British catwalks last year, more than 60% of shows featured fur, and at New York fashion week the figure topped 70%. While luxury labels such as Fendi have a long history of featuring real fur in their shows, fur is increasingly being used by newer brands as well. In New York, the up-and-coming label Cushnie Et Ochs said fur was its favourite material of the season, adding that it was “not ashamed”.

This month Karl Largerfeld said he would be putting on a special “couture fur” show to mark his 50th anniversary of working for Fendi. “For me, fur is Fendi and Fendi is fur, fun furs” he said. “Fendi is my Italian version of creativity. The Fendi haute fourrure fashion show is the opportunity to stage the royal furs of furs.”

He told the New York Times: “For me, as long as people eat meat and wear leather, I don’t get the message. It’s very easy to say no fur, no fur, no fur, but it’s an industry. Who will pay for all the unemployment of the people if you suppress the industry of the fur?”

In the 80s it was a serious fashion faux pas to step out in real fur, but today’s celebrities are rarely seen out of it. Rihanna and Rita Ora have recently been pictured in real mink coats, and Kim Kardashian dressed her one-year-old daughter North West in what was thought to be a $3,500 (£2,300) crystal fox fur coat at last month’s New York fashion week.

Lady Gaga made a Naomi Campbell-esque turnabout on the issue. Having initially denounced fur, she was later pictured in a full-length coat made of white pelt, and went on to say: “You see a carcass, I see a museum pièce de résistance.”

Mark Oaten, CEO of the International Fur Federation, said he was unsurprised by the growth in productionas the taboo around wearing real fur was fading into irrelevance. “We knew from the catwalks that fur is certainly being used much more by designers and from some of the retail figures, which can be patchy and difficult, that the sales are going strongly,” he said. “So with this increase in demand, farmers are deciding to invest more in fur farms and increase production.”

Oaten, a former Liberal Democrat MP, said Asia and Hong Kong remained the big players in the fur trade, both in terms of demand and production, but emphasised there was a shift towards buyers in America and Europe.

“Designers appear to be embracing it, customers appear to be embracing it and we certainly find the younger generation have less of an issue with fur than the younger generation of the 1980s,” he said.

“But it’s changed rapidly, even in the past three or four months. We’ve seen a change of patterns of the kind of consumers in Asia. Six months ago I would have said Beijing and Shanghai are really hot markets, but now we are seeing a shift away to the second- and third-tier cities in China as well. We’ve also seen an enormous increase in America because fur has had an incredibly busy runway and it has also been extraordinarily cold.”

In the UK, members of the British Fur Trade Association reported a 20% increase in sales last year. The association’s chief executive, Mike Moser, said the growth was being driven as much by younger generations as by foreign millionaires.

“It’s hot stuff because fur is being used in a real fun way in fashion now,” he said. “It’s more accessible for young people because of the increase of fur trims on coats and fur accessories.

“The BFTA runs an annual competition for design students using fur and this year we’ve seen a 50% increase in the number of students taking art. They just want to use fur in their designs which proves there such a strong interest in the younger generation.”

While the fur industry in countries such as Canada, the US and Europe remains heavily regulated, concerns remain over China, which is much more lax about the welfare of animals. Oaten conceded it was a concern for the IFF and said cleaning up the Chinese fur trade remained a priority.

“Obviously with so much mink coming from China, one of my big priorities is to make sure that they understand what the requirements are for welfare,” he said. “I was in China a couple weeks ago meeting with government officials. They have already adopted Council of Europe guidelines on welfare and we’ve had a long dialogue with them to implement even stronger welfare protocols. The difficulty does still lie in ensuring these regulations are always enforced in such a large country.”

Oaten said he was a personal fan of pelts. “I use a lot of fur for interiors,” he said. “Though I’ve not yet found a fur coat that suits me.”",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/mar/25/fur-trade-booming-fashion-catwalks#comments," So a former Lib Dem is now getting paid to promote Chinese fur? Unsurprising. But grotesque nonetheless. The conditions under which these animals are killed and the total absence of adequate origin labelling on fur products means that those who consume them are condoning barbaric cruelty. Both in the killing and 'farming' of these creatures. The conditions under which they are kept in China is well documented. You better have a strong stomach before viewing the footage, it's sickening. Fur's 'rehabilitation' is an indictment of the vacuous narcissism which dominates media in the 21st century. Those who drape themselves in the pelt of a once beautiful dead animal reveal a deep inner ugliness. Shameful.", Proof...the rich don't give a fuck!, Who will pay for all the unemployment of the people if you suppress the industry of the fur?” Karl Largerfeld is a cock.," If every person who wanted to wear real fur was made to kill and skin the animals I wonder how many would still want to. Just when you think there may be a ray of hope for the human race it becomes obvious that we are, mostly, no better than cave-dwellers when it comes to respect for fellow creatures."," - this just illustrates the &quot;don't give a f***&quot;-ness of today's consumer culture. No one cares if the animals are killed in the most ghastly and painful way you could imagine. No one cares if they're kept in tiny cages. It's all ME ME ME. The fashion industry is a load of impermanent, self-aggrandising toss. People like Lagerfield (not Largerfeld) and Gaga are so taken up with their own importance, they see nothing else. One has pity for these people, but they take our general humanity down several notches. The fur trade is vile."," The fur trade is revolting and unnecessary. Fur wearers, stop turning those conveniently-deaf ears and recognize the cruelty inflicted because of people like yourselves."," Just as ISIS numb recruits to murder and violence by repeated exposure, so too the fur industry has numbed designers and the public to the murder and violence they commit on living beings. The argument that it employs people is worthless. Selling guns employs people. Raping children on webcam employs people. Employment is not an excuse for atrocity. At the end of the day fur is for wankers, poseurs and social climbers who don't realise the only status it connotes is that of callous moron. There is no 'fun fur' only needlessly dead flesh."," Wearing other animals as garments is very backward. What should be fashionable (if you had an iota of intelligence) is to clearly recognise that minks, foxes, sables etc. are essential intrinsic entities and cannot be reduced to a resource."," Disgusting trade! Civilisation moving backwards, I despair!!"," The horrors of the fur industry have been well documented - see for example, the links supplied here by others. A revolting business."," Disgusting, only people who live in extreme cold conditions, have any excuse whatsoever."," a desperate industry looking for something to exploit when it has no ideas of its own, same with the faux retro shit - its not a relook at the past its a &quot;no idea&quot; generation of designers - they never learnt to draw and they never learnt to think outside the box - yes that famous tick box generation. This in the Arts but it will be the same in all the other subjects - another Thatcher project gone wrong As to the fur -DON&quot;T BUY ANYTHING WITH FUR ON AND IF THE SHOP HAS FUR ON THE HANGERS GO SOMEWHERE ELSE"," Can you imagine being smashed against the floor headfirst, hung upside down, and then having your skin stripped from your muscle tissue feet-first while you are falling in and out of consciousness? Because that's what those animals go through. That is the cruelty of the fur trade that people talk about. Why, Hannah Ellis-Petersen, did you not mention the reality of this horrific cruelty in your disgusting article? Fuck you and fuck 'fashion'.", I thought we had moved forward. Apparently not. Those dunderheads who enjoy being lead by fashion and trends will be aware that at least half the people who look at them will not be thinking they look good.," With the quality and choice of faux fur so high (synthetic furs are now softer, and can be made in milions of visually appealing styles) I dont see the attraction. Saying that, it's no different to leather, unless your wearing an endangered animal."," Planet fashion is a demented, cruel and otherworldly affair. That famous Sasha Baron Coen sketch as Bruno, epitomes it. He teases a fashion PR guy about Nazi uniforms being &quot;so this year&quot; and the guy just roles with it with total enthusiasm. A woman high up in the British Fashion Council was on the radio recently talking about the moronic success of places like Bicester Village. She claimed selling &quot;designer&quot; brands was an expression of British identity abroad and the future goal was to lavish more tax payer money attracting Chinese tourists to Britain to buy handbags made guess where:? In China but cheaper here. Madness! There's Vivian Westwood still but she's an exception."," This is disgusting, take a look at how these animals are killed in China, they are skinned alive, not just mink etc but cats, dogs and rabbits, and as for that comment about the only people who have a right to campaign are veggies, anyone has the right to campaign against such terrible cruelty, what a smug attitude, go and look at the campaigns against the fur trade and see the photographs for yourselves", It's fashion people's use of the word &quot;fun&quot; that is almost as disgusting as the wearing of fur. There is no fun for the animals. Stella McCartney at least sticks by her beliefs. Shame on the rest of them.," I just don't understand why, in the 21st century, humans still think that wearing fur is somehow a fashion statement. I mean it's not as if anyone can say that they didn't know of the suffering caused by this most barbaric trade. Sickens me to the core."," I've lived abroad for almost 10 years now and have grown accustomed to seeing fur on the streets of European cities (though not Germany). But I was shocked at how many people I saw wearing fur on my last visit to London earlier this year. I really thought we British were more sensitive to this, saw it as a bigger taboo - especially since the 80s. It's such a shame this is becoming &quot;acceptable&quot; again. It's not like wearing leather (the byproduct of animals we eat). Fox, mink, sable - I don't see anyone rustling up a casserole with these. And those that argue they're &quot;not buying new fur, but recycling with the vintage trend&quot;, that's a poor excuse because you're only legitimising and propagating the fashion trend. Honest to god, I've seen a so-called vegetarian wear a &quot;vintage&quot; fur coat.", I have a fun fur on my lap at this moment. Alive and purring. The only state a fun fur should inhabit.," I wish someone tried to get a piece of skin from that muppet called &quot;Karl Largerfeld&quot;. Its loathsome to see such people making money out of the cruelty that is involved in the fur industry. People like him need to see how the skin is grabbed out from the animal while they are still alive. I cannot find words to express my disgust, because Guardian will moderate me."," The earth has now become a living hell for animals because of the fur, meat, dairy, egg, leather and wool industries as well as for those enslaved in zoos, circuses, canned hunts and marine parks around the world. Animals have been reduced to resources and production units rather than living, breathing beings capable of feeling emotions such as love, fear, terror and pain. Until we end the demand by making ethical and compassionate choices and start viewing animals as those that we share the world with rather than those that we can plunder and exploit then these industries and the associated horrors will never cease.", What a dreadful article. Was it sponsored by the International Fur Federation? Nice to know the Guardian is now a mouthpiece for the fur industry..., People are so detached from where things come from these days! They are too self absorbed in themselves to realise they are perpetuating the suffering of animals. It's absolutely vile!," I have watched some video of Chinese fur farms in action and cried my eyes out - it is hard to imagine that this unspeakable horror goes on day by day relentlessly for an industry that turns over in excess of $10 Billion. What struck me forcibly though was the appalling and brutal indifference that the men (it is mainly men) who carried out this butchery of living animals many of whom were still alive at the end of the skinning exhibited. Very similar to that shown in other videos of the Canadian seal slaughter and so many other vile hunting practices of mankind. It is extraordinary behaviour and one cannot help but wonder the evolutionary value of such behaviour – it seems so aberrant (and not confined to Homo Sapiens, although our species seems to be the most extreme version). The ongoing onslaught against the natural world is why I have switched a substantial proportion of my charitable giving to PETA &amp; the EIA. Please think about providing similar support; we can only hope to get change to these terrible practices by exposing them as most people know horror when they see it.", It could only happen in Tory Britain.. they really don't care a f**k about anything except themselves.. soon it will be lampshades, Fur only looks good on the animal who is meant to wear it! and that's not some pathetic human," Looking at the people that wear these so called fashion furs tells its own story. I thought the fur trade was dead and buried a long time ago. The fact it is thriving again is a sad indictment of our sad apathetic society. I hope there are those with influence out there that do care about the sheer cruelty in the fashion fur trade and make an example of those who exploit it. Those who buy and wear it in the name of fashion are beneath contempt. If you must wear fur, then what is wrong with fake fur?"," I can't believe what I've just read, this whole article is like a huge advert for the fur trade but where is the other side of the story? One tiny conciliatory bit at the end about animal welfare in China but nothing about the pain and suffering these animals go through all over the world for the sake of vanity and the soulless fashion industry. How about the difference in opinion about wearing fur in this country compared to others? to read this article you would think it's now perfectly acceptable. If you're going to write an article at least try and do it without sounding like you're pitching for a job with a fashion house Hannah double barrel"," What? Have we regressed as a society, The argument that the fur trade was cruel and unacceptable had been won. Perhaps everything is cyclical.

How can we be so selfish ? The cruelty of man never ceases to amaze me, seriously. It is completely absurd."," As the famous 1980's anti fur ad said &quot;It takes 40 dumb animals to make a coat, but only one to wear it&quot; What a sad, retrograde situation brought about by the young generation of fashonistas; I suppose the next step will be to bring back bear-baiting. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXGbeG3BTxE", Anyone who wears furs deserves a savage beating., This is so depressing. I thought even the fashionistas had grown beyond torturing and killing animals to feed their restless longing for mindless novelty. Has to be challenged., That hideous woman Anna Wintour is to blame.

People wear leather shoes because they are hardy, durable, good quality, last for years. People wear fur trims on their hoodies because they look good. Not really the same, is it?

The fur trade is a cruelty industry and I can't believe we are going backwards as a society. I remember the anti-seal fur campaigns in the 80's, it really was the beginning of a path into living with a conscience for me. I can accept hunters kill animals for fur to keep warm, there are so many substitutes however. The entire fashion industry is garbage, full of shallow, self absorbed people pretending to be more important than they actually are in the big scheme of life.

The internet discussed little else for days, for this was a story with many talking points.

Kate Moss flies easyJet, for a start. Kate Moss carries vodka in her handbag (allegedly). And controversy: was Moss throwing her weight around on the flight, demanding attention from the crew because of her celebrity? Or did easyJet throw the rulebook at Moss because she was a woman in the public eye who had had a few drinks?

But all of the above was just fish-and-chip paper, a moment of celebrity misconduct destined to be just a footnote under Ben Affleck and Gavin Rossdale. The detail of this story that changed the course of 2015 was the insult Moss lobbed at the pilot as she was escorted from the plane. She called her a “basic bitch”, and overnight a cult, hitherto underground term of abuse hit the mainstream.

You know what it means to call someone “basic”, right? You are basic if you pride yourself on possessions or preferences that you consider to be cool or aspirational, but which are in fact commonplace or obvious. Being basic is liking what it is typical to like.

Drinking pumpkin spice latte, for instance, is basic, as is instagramming your brunch or tweeting about the arrival of Pret’s Christmas sandwich. Duckface in photos is basic. Inspirational quotes on social media are basic. The hashtag #AboutLastNight is basic. Right now, being “obsessed” with your beauty advent calendar is basic. (Come to think of it, hashtags per se and being “obsessed” with anything are basic.) Basic is following trends and thinking that this makes you special, when to those who police pop culture you are eye-rollingly predictable. What the rise of basic as an insult tells us about 2015 is how labyrinthine the rulebook of cultural engagement has become. A few years ago, you could put down someone who wasn’t quite keeping up with the trends by calling them “naff”, which essentially meant they were six months behind. The trouble is, now that social media provides a rolling ticker-tape news-feed of what’s in and what’s out, no one is six months behind any more. You don’t need to hang out with the cool kids to know what’s up; it’s all on Instagram. So basic is a put-down aimed at those who imagine that being on-trend makes them cool. It is an insult that skewers something about the way social media turned nasty this year, because there is something very snobbish about mocking people for conformity, about an elite laughing at less sophisticated folk who trustingly follow style rules and think this will be good enough.

Sylvia Plath c 1954. Photograph: CSU Archv/Everett/Rex Features

It’s tricky to pinpoint the birth of basic, because the word as an insult is simply an exaggeration of what the word basic means in the vernacular. Sylvia Plath uses basic as a scathing term for social behaviour in her Unabridged Journals, in 1950: recalling an attempt to make conversation in a fraternity room, she writes: “You’ve had all you can take of good-looking vacuums and shallow socialites. So you try to be basic.”

In the 1989 film Say Anything, Diane (Ione Skye) knocks back Lloyd (John Cusack) by calling him basic. In Clueless, Cher Horowitz mocks a group of rival peers in the mall with the cuss “Could they please be more generic?” – for generic in 1995, read basic in 2015.

But basic as a pejorative adjective for women really happened around 2010, with Lil Wayne’s I’m Not a Human Being – verbatim quotes not breakfast-table appropriate, but essentially his point is that he drives around in cars and gets a lot of blowjobs, and therefore is not basic, and Kreayshawn’s 2010 single Gucci Gucci. (“Gucci Gucci, Louis Louis, Fendi Fendi, Prada; the basic bitches wear that shit; so I don’t even bother.”)

The key question at the end of 2015, of course, is whether basic is still a thing. A nascent movement to reclaim the word never quite took off, essentially because being truly basic is incompatible with that level of nuance. For all its dubiousness, it can still be funny, in a deeply childish way. (See: Marc Jacobs and Kate Moss reenacting a classic basic bitch meme in a video where they stage whisper the accusation that we, the public, are basic).

Basic is nasty when it is used as a put-down to women who dare to think themselves special (“27 signs you’re dating a basic bitch”); but can still be pretty satisfying as a way to call out a man who is pleased with himself for no obvious reason.

Sure, it's annoying when people post pictures of Starbucks coffee cups or inspirational quotes on Instagram, but just unfollow them! There is absolutely nothing wrong with not being ashamed for liking what you like, whether it's cool or not. The idea that someone could call you out for liking mainstream things too much is ridiculous. As for Kate Moss, she should be ashamed of herself."," And the article is just rounded off with a bit of casual sexism. Call any man you like basic, but with women it's just 'nasty'.

The Treasury has given the green light to proposals that will open up the possibility of part-privatising Defence Equipment and Support (DE&S), the body within the Ministry of Defence in charge of procuring everything from new warships to lightbulbs.

Despite concern from union leaders, experts and former military personnel, the plan has been under consideration for almost a year as ministers and senior civil servants grapple with ways of saving money within defence.

With an annual budget of £15bn and 15,000 staff, DE&S plays a crucial role for the MoD, and no other nation has ever privatised such an integral part of the military machine.

But DE&S has been criticised for allowing expensive projects to run out of control, partly because of too much meddling from military commanders, prompting defence secretary Philip Hammond to consider private sector involvement.

In an announcement expected on Thursday, ministers will say they are pursuing reforms in which DE&S will remain government owned, but not government run. Day-to-day management would be undertaken by a private company, possibly from abroad.

During an assessment phase, the MoD will seek bids from firms in the hope this will show running costs can be slashed. A trial period is expected to last many months, but analysts suspect the so-called GoCo option (government-owned, contractor-operated) will probably get the go-ahead because it is the preferred option of the civil servant currently in charge of DE&S – Bernard Gray, the chief of defence materiel.

One idea is for procurement in the RAF to act as the guinea pig for GoCo, before turning over the entire organisation to the private sector by 2015.

Hammond has conceded it is ""challenging"" to recruit staff into DE&S to run complex projects worth billions of pounds when the MoD can only offer them civil service pay.

Union leaders say this is a poor reason to hand over defence procurement to private companies and fear the MoD is being driven into risky cost-cutting exercises.

""It's a sorry state of affairs when the Ministry of Defence decides to contract out control of £15bn of annual public spending for the simple reason that the Treasury won't allow it to pay its staff properly and enable it to hire and retain quality people with the right skills and experience,"" said a spokesman for Prospect, the union that represents thousands of defence engineers and scientists.

The Royal United Services Institute thinktank has also raised fears about inviting contractors in to run DE&S.

""Try as we did, we were able to discern only two clear arguments in favour of GoCo, neither of which is convincing and one of which may be undemocratic,"" a research paper concluded last year.

""The MoD could acquire the services of a better class of managers, because a company can pay higher salaries than the public sector. However, the prime minister could easily give dispensation for a limited number of such people to be brought into the MoD at special salaries. That would be a transparent approach, whereas if a company is brought in details of the salaries of its staff could be kept away from parliament, the media and the public.""

The study added: ""A company might be more resistant to accepting proposals for changes [to equipment] from the [military]. That would help to control costs, but would also increase the chances that MoD forces would be equipped with inappropriate and inadequate equipment.""

In a separate report published in February, the defence select committee said that ""GoCo is not universally accepted as the best way forward"" and warned: ""Failures in the acquisition process can lead to loss of life.""

MPs acknowledged defence procurement had ""presented intractable problems"" over recent years, but expressed anxiety that a foreign company might be chosen to run DE&S.

The announcement is likely to say that ministers want to launch a competition in the private sector and then set up an ""investment appraisal"" that will compare the GoCo option against ""an improved version of the status quo"", known as DE&S-Plus.

An MoD source said: ""This is the culmination of a lengthy process across Whitehall to get the go-ahead for the assessment phase for a GoCo, and it now gives DE&S the ability to further explore opportunities. A white paper will be brought forward to outline our radical plans to reform defence procurement, which has been plagued with delays and cost overruns in recent history.""",https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/apr/24/mod-poised-privatise-part-defence-procurement#comments, There's a chap selling bomb detectors who'd be perfect for the job..., I don't really care any more.

But the service provider applies a mark-up (of up to 9%) to what is charged for everything purchased on the MoD's behalf. This creates a conflict of interest. The MoD want the service provider to reduce the cost of procurement but the service provider has a strong financial incentive to buy as much as possible.

There are also instances of real success and the focus has come from recent wars like Iraq and Afghan where it actually matters if kit is of great quality and a lot of really duff equipment has been phased out and replaced with things that work..this has not happened by magic.

Transport minister Norman Baker has admitted the current rail fare structure is ""not ideal"" and said the government wants to end above-inflation rises as soon as possible, as commuters returned to work after the Christmas break to face sharp fare increases.

Campaigners claim that fares for season ticket holders have risen by as much as 50% in the past decade, making travelling to work by train an extravagance that growing numbers of people struggle to afford.

Commuters returning to work face average season ticket increases of 4.3% and an overall rise on ticket prices of 3.9%. The Campaign for Better Transport (CBT) says these are just the latest in a series of fare increases, which are having an ""appalling"" impact on commuters.

Baker said a fares and ticketing review was examining the balance of regulation and which fares are regulated. Approximately 40% of fares are regulated by the government. The other 60% are unregulated and decided by the train companies themselves, he said.

""It's not ideal – there are over 100,000 rail tickets and different prices each year to deal with,"" Baker told Radio 4's Today programme. ""It's a hugely complicated issue.""

He added: ""So it's important we try to get the best value for the passenger, the best value for the taxpayer and the simplest, [most] transparent system we can, given the need to ensure rail companies can price appropriately to attract people on to off-peak trains, which might otherwise be running empty.""

CBT said its research showed that in the past decade London commuters have seen average season ticket costs increase by £1,300; fares growing 20% faster than wages; and average costs in real terms increasing by £360.

The CBT chief executive, Stephen Joseph, said: ""It's truly shocking that we have deliberately made getting the train to work an extravagance that many struggle to afford. The time has come not just to stop the rises but to reduce fares.""

In the past 10 years, rail fares rose significantly in all parts of England but there were big differences between routes over that period. Annual fares from Sevenoaks in Kent to London have increased by nearly 90%, from £1,660 to £3,112; and from Wednesday, commuters travelling between Worcester and Birmingham Moor Street will pay £1,240 for a season ticket compared with £816 in 2003 – an increase of £424 or 52%.

The TUC said average train fares had risen nearly three times faster than average wages since the beginning of the recession in 2008. It said this ""huge disparity"" between fare and wage increases meant that a family of four travelling to London on an Anytime ticket from Swansea, Plymouth, Leeds, Manchester or Newcastle in 2013 would have to pay more than the average weekly wage of £481.

The TUC general secretary, Frances O'Grady, said: ""At a time when real wages are falling and household budgets are being squeezed, rail travellers are being forced to endure yet another year of inflation-busting fare increases.

""As well as having to shell out record amounts of money for their tickets, passengers also face the prospect of travelling on trains with fewer staff and having less access to ticket offices. They are being asked to pay much more for less.""

Michael Roberts, the chief executive of the Association of Train Operating Companies, blamed the government. He said: ""Ministers want passengers to pay a larger share of railway running costs to reduce the contribution from taxpayers while sustaining investment in better stations, new trains and faster services.""

Labour said it would impose a ""strict"" cap on future rail fare rises, accusing the prime minister, David Cameron, of misleading commuters. The government had intended to allow train companies to raise the average price of regulated fares – which include season tickets – by retail prices inflation plus 3% this and next January.

In October, Cameron announced it would instead be limited to RPI plus 1% – a 4.2% rise. However, Labour said the government had undermined its pledge by reinstating flexibility, allowing firms to raise non-regulated fares.

The shadow transport secretary, Maria Eagle, said: ""David Cameron misled commuters when he promised to cap fare rises at 1% above inflation. Many commuters have faced a nasty new year shock as they discover fares have gone up by as much as 9.2% … Labour would strictly enforce the fare cap on every route and restore the ban on train companies imposing higher increases.""",http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jan/02/rail-fare-structure-not-ideal#comments," The train tickets make no sense whatsoever. Recent examples - Example 1:- 6 weeks ago, I tried to book a ticket from Haddenham and Thame Parkway (Bucks) to Ely in Cambridgeshire for 31st December, then from there to Heathrow for the 1st January to fly back to Germany. It initially turned out to be &pound;20 cheaper to hire a car and drive it (including the fuel burn and penalty for not returning the car to the original car hire site. I then tried to split the train tickets, and found that without changing my train times(!) it was cheaper still if I bought a ticket from Haddenham to High Wycombe, another from High Wycombe to London, an oyster single across London, a return from London to Cambridge, a return from Cambridge to Ely and an oyster single across London back to Heathrow. Example 2:- At the same time, an elderly neighbour wanted to get a cheap return from Haddenham to Dundee. I found her a return train ticket that was &pound;10 cheaper than mine was to Ely then on to Heathrow. I wanted to travel 160 miles or so over 2 days, she wanted to travel over 500. It makes no sense at all; if you have to travel via London the prices are ridiculous.", Have been listening to a radio debate about this today. It is interesting to hear people say that becuase we have lots of different rail companies we have competition. We do not. I use the train company that takes me from the town where I live (Milton Keynes) using the West coast main line. We have two different train companies but only one runs trains that you can use to commute. I am not going to travel 10-20 miles first thing in the morning to go to Bedford or another town that another provider goes from. Lets be honest rail companies are privatised menopoilies with no real competition. When we use then we are reliant upon the regulator to rein them in. It is in their nature to charge more for less - if the regulator lets them.," My monthly rail ticket from Bicester to London back in Oct 2009 was around &pound;400. This morning it cost very nearly &pound;500. That's an increase of 25% in 3 years and 3 months. My pay rises have not been even in line with inflation during that period. I've worked out if I work more locally I could afford to take a pay cut of around &pound;8000 per annum and still have the same disposable income. It's becoming increasingly attractive and cost effective to work locally and drive there, which is probably the opposite of what public transport policy was once supposed to do. Chiltern Railways to their credit operate a punctual service (more or less) and I still remember the delays we used to get with good old BR. However we got the line upgraded to work more quickly a year ago, and barring a few headline services which operate 10 minutes faster, a lot of services still take over an hour to get between London and Bicester. The increase in rail fare is simply unacceptable in my view."," Unless there's a glitch on the National Rail website, I'm not going to be able to afford to finish my PhD with the new fares. My once a week trek from Godalming to Coventry cost &pound;15.80 before Christmas; apparently, it's now &pound;76. Same trains, same stations, same railcard. I can leave later and return home (substantially) later to get it down to &pound;34.65 - but that's still more than double! Mind you, I also must book these tickets at least 3 weeks in advance..."," I just did 300 miles (220 on motorways) on half a tank (&pound;65 to fill it) in my 1.6 Golf. And I had a passenger. I would have cost us close to &pound;100 each on the train. Obviously this doesn't compare to daily commuting. I also drive the daily commute with a passenger and it costs around &pound;70 a month. Monthly passes are around &pound;60-70 each. I know I still have the cost of the car (already paid in cash), depreciation (although I bought it at 3 years old, so that's more the previous owner's problem), insurance, tax and servicing, but it's still worth it, especially taking into account the one-off journeys. I've also noticed on the few occasions when I've had to use the train to get to work that FCC seem to employ an awful lot of staff to man the ticket barriers. At Hitchin station I normally see 4 or 5 (2 of which who are normally scratching their balls) when they only have 4 barriers there. Where's the logic? Car sharing is the way forward."," When rail privatisation was first mooted, its supporters said that fairs would rise at one percent below inflation, due to the 'efficiencies' of the private sector. This should be borne in mind whenever we hear the siren calls from the Tory right to privatise the health service to unleash private sector 'innovation'.", Its called CAPITALISM. Profit. Profit. Profit.," Rail fare structure 'not ideal', admits transport minister 'Water still wet' says duck..."," Ending the rises is one thing, but we need a price cut too. Many people can't afford train fares already and salaries aren't moving up. It'll never happen of course. Meanwhile it continues to be cheaper to drive despite the stupid petrol prices. Oh, and this is BS: &quot;Labour said it would impose a &quot;strict&quot; cap on future rail fare rises, accusing the prime minister David Cameron of misleading commuters.&quot; Labour did f-all to help when they were in power, and like the Tories saying they'll end PFI this will just be something that is forgotten when (if) they're elected."," Labour said it would impose a &quot;strict&quot; cap on future rail fare rises Labour are too good at promising to do things which they failed to do when in power.When Bliar took over, privatisation was not complete and could be stopped, so this traitor to the party is as much to blame as Major."," We live in a country where we work to subsidise all manner of services we can't use. We work to increase the profit for private shares. We must often choose between heat and food. We can't always afford travel to work, but so be it, we will simply work another job. The fat cats say we are broke, they say conditions are not 'ideal', they say we should travel off peak, they say we must make do. Something is very very wrong with this picture."," Another fine example of Privatisation doing better than state owned thingies.,.

That is just ridiculous," This is actually disgusting. I catch trains quite regularly, and far from improving the standards of service are sliding with each passing year.

Perhaps there should be a method in place whereby a low-paid worker can submit her/his utilities bills and rail tickets at the end of each month and claim back a sensible reduction in the cost of both. It's simply ridiculous that someone should be losing several months' salary simply to pay the cost of getting to and from work. How, exactly, does this fit in with government's alleged intention to 'make work pay'? And once again, this is another price rise which affects women disproportionately hardest as the majority of lower-paid admin and office workers - secretaries, admin assistants, office caterers, office cleaners etc. are women.", Renationionalise.," For me high rail prices mean that I'm struggling to get my career started. With a Masters in Social Policy and Research the sector is almost exclusively London based, yet despite living only an hour away by train the cost of travel is astronomical - so much so I can't even afford to attend interviews."," Renationalise the railways and treat them as a public service, not a profit-making machine for exploitative and self-interested regional monopolies. That's that one solved. Now let's move on to energy (more private monopolies), schools (absurd two-tier system), public housing (lack of), and everything else screwed up over the past 30 years."," This whole policy is insanity. A properly subsidised, centrally organised public transport network would be a massive boost to the economy of this country, it's in all our interests even if you don't use the train. And as for David Cameron's claims of being the 'greenest government ever'.. it's just offensive."," Do stop going on about Cameron pledging a 1% cap on rail fare rises. Just accept that Cameron is a liar. He was born a liar, he trained as a liar, and is now so good at it that he can lie without realizing that he's doing it."," The train companies have also put up &quot;fares&quot; hugely by big rises in car parking charges. Havant has risen by 100% since 2006. Pure greed to take extra money as the rail regulator can't touch them on car parking. It also has a negative impact on the local area as people use residential streets to park and then the council has to bring in more parking restrictions, cost borne by tax payers etc etc. Greed without consideration for society."," When 48% of seats on the West Coast mainline are empty during peak times because it now costs &pound;150+ to go from Manchester to London, and yet the prices increase again then the market simply isn't working. As train companies would rather fill one in two seats at that price than all of them at &pound;50 each. Of course if you get the first off peak train then you can enjoy standing up for two hours if you can get on it that is. When markets work they are great, but the railways don't because it's not a free market, it's a privatised monopoly, and they simply won't work. Nationalise the system, and pay the companies a flat fee to run the services, that way we can still have competition to drive down bureaucracy and costs, but have standards maintained by a publically accountable democratically elected authority. The government can set all the prices, sell all the ticket and collect all the fares, just like it does in London. Then the prices will be set at the level that best fits the public good rather than the profit motive. Bureaucracy and costs will decrease with a simplifying ticketing system that doesn't require money being split several different ways, or different websites to buy your ticket from, different machines at different stations, and ticket inspectors on every train all employed by different companies. Every station can have the same machine and every journey can be paid for in advance rather than on the train, the amount of people who travel for free because no-one comes round to collect their &pound;3.20 is ridiculous.

Here's one snippet from a travel guide on Cuba&quot; Fast trains 1 &amp; 2 between Havana and Santiago now use comfortable stainless-steel air-conditioned coaches bought second-hand from French Railways and now known as the 'Tren Franc&eacute;s'. These coaches were originally used on the glamorous Trans-Europe Express (TEE) service between Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam before being replaced with high-speed Thalys trains. They were shipped to Cuba in 2001 It seems the Cubans had the good sense to buy from the French - people who know how to deliver a decent railway system."," Everything about modern Britain is as mad as it is evil. That said, this has been obvious for many years. So if you haven't reorganized your life and work to avoid being ripped off by the UK's train system, you only have yourself to blame."," Whatever happened to 'best practice' ? The French and Germans both have nationally owned, efficient, relatively inexpensive (for the traveller) modern railway systems. Surely we can learn something from them ?"," British Rail was slagged off by the Tories for being inefficient because it was state owned. Shall we look at how other countries &quot;inefficient&quot; public railways manage? You don't even need to leave the UK: SNCF (Keolis) Joint franchise operator of Southern, Southeastern, London Midland &amp; Transpennine. Profits go to the French government NedRail (Abellio) Joint franchise operator of Merseyrail, Northern &amp; Greater Anglia. Profits go to the Dutch government DB (Arriva) Franchise operator / owner of Arriva Trains Wales, Cross Country, Grand Central, Chiltern, London Overground. Profits go to the German government. In short, public subsidy to the rail system has QUINTUPLED since privatisation. Fares have gone up massively ahead of inflation. And the majority of train operators are the nationalised state operations from elsewhere in Europe. Your subsidy and your fares subsidise the taxpayers of France, Germany and the Netherlands thanks to the preposterous privatisation inflicted on us by Major, and left untouched by Blair."," Prices have been allowed to escalate as politicians have not dared question the status quo.

I worked this out when I got to the station, and had to shell out another &pound;100 for two more tickets (which is pretty steep). The thing that bothered me was that nobody was interested in refunding the tickets - they simply won't. How many other industries/sectors work like this? I had bought something that, until the 23rd of Jan, wouldn't cost the rail company anything at all, and could easily be refunded and resold (probably for a higher price given that it is closer to the date) without the item depreciating in value like, say, a pair of shoes I bought and returned would do.

Darling deferred much of the pain until 2011 – including a 0.5 % increase in national insurance on anyone earning more than £20,000 – as he tried to soften the potentially lethal political impact before the general election.

The chancellor said a £178bn budget deficit this year made higher taxes, spending restraint and a two-year clampdown on public sector pay unavoidable, but said that unlike the Conservatives, Labour would defer the pain until the economy had gained strength. ""The choice facing the country is between securing recovery or wrecking it,"" he said as he admitted the economy would contract by 4.75% this year – the biggest fall since 1921.

As punishment for the City, he also imposed a populist one-off 50% tax on bankers' bonuses of more than £25,000. The Tories said they would not oppose the measure, which would also impose a levy on the banks who choose to reward their staff instead of building up cash reserves.

But after the well-publicised raid on the City, Darling delivered a surprise measure to claw £3bn a year from modestly paid workers. Everybody earning more than £20,000 would be affected by a half a percentage point increase in NI from April 2011.The rise will cost a worker on the average UK income of £25,000 a year an extra £4 a week.

The Tories instantly pledged to make the repeal of the national insurance rise their top priority, describing it as ""a tax on jobs and on the many"".

David Cameron's advisers believe the dire state of public finances makes it more likely Gordon Brown will call a March election – two months earlier than anticipated. Labour would not want to hold a full budget immediately before the election, the Tories predicted.

George Osborne, the shadow chancellor said: The full scale of the economic disaster that Labour has visited upon the country is clear to all of us."" Business leaders and the Conservatives said it was remarkable that the tax rises announced today were not being used to pay off debt more quickly, but instead to protect ""frontline"" public services, specifically an extra £15bn over two years for schools, hospitals and keeping up police numbers.

Darling did little to define frontline services, but the children's schools and families department said 80% of its budget was protected up to 2012.

In what is a key dividing line for Darling, he also promised he would continue with the £30bn spending rises he had announced for 2010-11, saying any cutback would choke off a fragile recovery. The Tories repeated tonight that cuts should start next year, adding they would ringfence only the health and relatively small overseas aid budgets.

Osborne also condemned Darling for hiding the scale of the spending cuts which will come across Whitehall after the election. The Institute of Fiscal Studies warned that other public services , such as housing, transport and higher education, faced cuts of 10% or more.

Darling announced a further £5bn in efficiency savings, including cuts in residential care, prisons and the science budget.

He also announced a series of measures to boost companies operating in hi-tech sectors of the economy, including £120m for green industries and a trade-in scheme to let homeowners replace their old boilers based on the car scheme.

Darling also risked alienating some of Labour's core vote when he announced he would impose a two-year below inflation pay deal of 1% on 3.9 million public sector workers . The Treasury is predicting inflation at 2% from 2011 to 2013, and claimed the 1 % cap on basic pay would generate savings of £3.4bn a year. In addition, state contributions to public sector pensions will be capped from 2012, eventually saving the Treasury £2bn.

Brendan Barber, general secretary of the TUC, described the pay cuts as arbitrary. ""Public sector workers – many of whom are low paid – should not have to pay the price for a crash they did nothing to cause,"" he said.

The chancellor claimed a combination of stronger growth, tax increases and a 0.8% increase in spending over the next three years would lead to a halving of the budget deficit. A smaller increase in unemployment and a recovery in share prices meant the deterioration in public finances since the Budget was not as pronounced as some analysts were expecting. Following this year's record drop in output, Darling said the economy would grow by a modest 1-1.5% next year but then pick up steam to expand by 3.5% in both 2011 and 2012.

""The steps that I have announced today are aimed at securing recovery, reducing borrowing, and through targeted investment, providing a springboard for long-term growth,"" Darling said.

Economists warned, however, that the Treasury's growth forecasts looked optimistic. Roger Bootle, economic adviser to Deloitte, said the fiscal projections were ""highly vulnerable"" to any slippage in economic growth. ""The forecast for 3.5% growth in 2011 and 2012 looks highly ambitious. If, as I suspect, growth turns out to be much weaker (and I expect 1.5% in 2011 and 2% in 2012) then the borrowing numbers will be much higher,"" he said. ""I forecast £190 billion for next year and £150 billion for the year after.

""But I doubt that the markets will be fazed by the PBR's inaction. The all-important announcements will come after the election, whoever wins it. This has been the Phoney Budget Report. The markets realise this.""

Martin Weale NIESR: ""I would give it about 3 out of 10. It all hangs on the growth forecasts and nothing is ever said about what will happen if it doesn't turn out as hoped. I hope it does turn out as they expect, but that is the most I can say.

A Labour government (sic) imposes a tax on the banks to curb their payment of big bonuses but messes it up so much that the bonuses can still be paid and the bankers get their money before the next election.  At the same time it increases NI (now just accepted as a tax like any other) on anyone earning over 20,000 which includes people earning less than the national average wage.  On top of this it enforces a 1% pay cap on public sector workers which will effectively act as a pay cut with inflation running at over 1%. So they are in effect making the lower earners poorer while the high earners can happily earn more? And they are accusing the Tories of looking after the wealthy?  That's rich (especially as figures released recently actually showed the poverty gap has widened in the last 12 years!) And all the time nobody mentions the elephant in the room - the national debt.  Darling did nothing that tackles the debt starting today.  It was ""if the economy picks up as we hope"" it will start to pay things back but nothing to actually help the economy recover.  Even the NI increase wouldn't be enough to cover the interest we're having to pay on the debt. Darling had a big chance to prove himself and the government to be strong and have the country's best interests at heart and they blew it.  I'm now off to vote Tory because if we are going to have a government that looks after the rich then at least I think we should have one that actually will sort out the economy no matter how much it hurts (and thanks to Brown, Darling, et al it is going to really hurt to sort this mess out.)",1,1,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,-1,0,0,1,0,-1,-1,0,-1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,-1,0,0,3,-1,0,-1,0,0,2,-1,0,0,2,1,1,0,1,0,0,-1,0,-1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,-1,3,0,1,0,-1,-1,2,1,0,0,2,-1,1,-1,2,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,-1,1,-1,2,-1,1,-1,0,1,2,1,0,-1,1,-1,1,-1,1,-1,0,-1,0,0,1,-1,3,-1,1,0,1,-1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,1,0,2,-1

Andy McNab, the former SAS soldier now turned best-selling author, said servicemen and women ""were very resilient"" and that the perception that significant numbers of them suffered PTSD was wrong.

McNab, who spent the best part of two decades in the army, said there was a trend for armed forces personnel wanting to leave before the end of their contract to claim they had PTSD in order to obtain a medical discharge and a pension.

""It is starting to be perceived as an honourable excuse for leaving prematurely,"" he said. ""It is in effect the new 'back problem', an injury that is very difficult to diagnose.""

McNab made the comments before an inquiry into the number of former armed services personnel who are in prison. The inquiry has been established by the Howard League for Penal Reform in response to concerns that a disproportionately large number of soldiers are ending up behind bars. The probation service, Napo, estimates there are some 8,500 former service personnel currently in prison – around 10% of the total prison population. The Ministry of Justice puts the figure at 2,500.

The inquiry's findings are likely to be studied closely by both the government and the armed forces. Several former service chiefs – including Admiral the Lord Boyce, the former head of the armed forces, and General Guthrie, former head of the army – have attended its evidence sessions. A report based on the inquiry's findings is due to be published in November to coincide with Armistice Day.

McNab identified a lack of education as a key factor in why such a high number of servicemen and women were ending up in jail. ""An average reading age within infantry is 11, but the army will recruit from a reading age of seven,"" McNab told the inquiry. ""The usual period an infantry soldier will stay in the army is between four to six years. When they leave the army, they will usually go back to the same environment they came from and often tried to escape by joining the army. They still have low literacy levels and, as infantry is very transient, no attachment to any other place. It is vital to get numeracy and literacy up, so that there is a broadening of horizon for these service leavers.""

He said that, with few qualifications or skills, a person's employment chances were limited once out of the army, where its ""tribal system"" had looked after them.

Given their lack of preparation for civilian life, it was inevitable, he said, that some would encounter problems and end up in the criminal justice system. ""The Ministry of Defence should recognise that it has a responsibility to progress the recruits, to educate, raise their aspirations and change their horizons for when they leave the army,"" McNab said. ""The MoD need to understand that from day one it should be drummed into recruits that one day they will leave the army, and you need to get prepared for that day. That is not happening at the moment.""

Andrew Neilson, assistant director of the Howard League, said that McNab's comments helped to shine new light on the reasons why former service personnel end up in prison.

""Our inquiry is hovering around this question of the extent to which former soldiers are in the prison system because of the pressures of active service, and the extent to which the real culprit is actually poverty,"" Neilson said. ""The army traditionally finds recruits from disadvantaged communities and many will return to those communities on leaving the services.""

Neilson added: ""The argument that the army could do more to enable social mobility and raise horizons is very much worth exploring, as that should have a direct impact on the numbers of veterans ending up in the criminal justice system. At the same time, however, there is a lot that mainstream services such as health and housing should also be doing to ensure we do not fail those who have served our country.""

McNab's comments about PTSD are likely to provoke controversy. In the US, research published by the National Institute of Mental Health estimated that 19% of Vietnam veterans experienced PTSD at some point after the war.

But McNab told the inquiry: ""The reason our armed services are more resilient to PTSD than, say, the US armed forces is that in the US there is a heavier reliance on the use of reserves. There is a distinction between the military and the reserve, people coming into the system for a year who have not got the depth and, although they are present physically, emotionally they are not part of the tribe.""",https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/13/armed-forces-stress-prisons-mcnab#comments," I have no wish to split hairs with a man who has served, indeed killed, for his country but I must ask Andy to qualify this startling reference to PTSD; ""It is starting to be perceived as an honourable excuse for leaving prematurely,"" he said. ""It is in effect the new 'back problem', an injury that is very difficult to diagnose."" I have been diagnosed with both a bad back and degree of PTSD, albeit at the mild end of the spectrum. Medical experts advised me  that as a gardener work was inadvisable and signed me off for three years. One of the experts who examined me seemed to have little trouble diagnosing the bad back (because I told them where it hurt) and the other asked me about my mental state, enquired to my alcohol intake, whether I had been under a great deal of stress (I had as it happens. split up with the missus, fighting in the courts overe the kid, homeless, jobless etc, a bit like quitea few of the squaddies I used to sell the Issue alongside really) whereupon they gave me some tablets and advised me to rest, excercise lightly, avoid carrying heavy loads and generally take it easy... Perhaps soldiers are less easy to diagnose with illness then civilians. I don;t know. What I do Know is that Andy is yet again trawling some nonsense that will encourage young adults to try to be tough and to endanger thier own and the lives of others around them by risking their mental and physical health because that's what soldiers do. BTW Andy I have read many of your books. I enjoyed the novels - especially the first one - Bravo Two Zero wasn't it? Some of the best fiction I ever read. Brilliant, quite brilliant Andy.

OGT", These Literary Threads.....tsssk! Don'tyajusthatethem?," I can't claim to have read any of this writer's works. But it seems he has conflated several unrelated subjects in order to make his point. The fact that some military personnel may have ""used"" a PTSD diagnosis to get out early really has nothing to do with the fact that British gaols are 10% full of soldiers. Au contraire - it seems likely that PTSD sufferers are more likely to find themselves imprisoned. Didn't an article in yesterday's Guardian state that high proportions of gaol inmates are mentally ill? The author goes on to say that poor education is the cause of incarceration. Isn't it glaringly obvious that desensitisation to violence is a much more likely cause? With or without a PTSD diagnosis? And why do the persons mentioned have such low reading ages? Might it not be because many of them have low IQs? I agree that better education for soldiers re-entering society is a good idea. I question the writer's route to this conclusion."," You know that old adage 'don't believe what you read in the papers' well, this looks like a prime example of misquoting/ taking remarks out of context/ irresponsible reporting to me - I can't believe McNab would say that PTSD is an excuse when he's worked with military charities with the very purpose of raising awareness of it (I heard him give a talk to troops on it - on a UK Army camp last year, as it happens) and he has talked openly about friends who have/are suffering from it. If you read the interview he did with Max Hastings in last week's FT then you'll know McNab had a reading age of 11 himself when he went into the army and that before that he went into the army from in juvenile detention.  So maybe he does know a bit about education and the prison system.  It would seem logical to me that you can't read and write and you've no hope of getting a job then you have nothing to loose and nicking stuff will probably seem like a not unreasonable option eventhough it might land you in prison.", No mention of the culture of heavy drinking?, Even if they had degrees would it make any difference given the hopeless employment and housing situation?," There are a number or issues and points raised here - PTSD and its effects Soldiers wanting out of the service, potentially using deception Low education/literacy levels in the forces / poor prospects once released PTSD is an opportunistic problem that can't be predicted for a specific individual -  put 2 people into the same situation and one/none/both may suffer from it.  As it's a longstanding condition experts are more knowledgeable and better able to disagnose.  I think McNab risks losing support for the people who are afflicted with this invisible disability. Solders wanting discharge and recruitment processes could be reviewed, with the target of improving post-discharge integration back into society as well as health and employment prospects.  Does it mean increasing standards for intake,  varied education whilst serving and/or post discharge programme change? McNab seems to point the finger at PTSD too much here,  and this risks undermining those service personnel who have given so much and now experience a serious condition - this is a real pity, as such people need better care, and don't deserve this."," What is an ex RM like ""radfan"" (as in Radfan Mnts: Yemen"") doing reading a paper like The Guardian"" ? 22SAS certainly came unstuck in ""our ""little affair, but none the less no sour grapes please.

It's irrelevant to the subject under discussion). What is a lad with little or no life experience and a sub-standard education, from a socially deprived background to do? He could theive, become a benefit scrounger, loaf at home or join the army. The chances of him breaking out of the cycle and leaving his family, friends and area of upbringing to persue self-betterment  outside the services are virtually nil. Without joining the army, he may end up in a young offenders institution or the slammer to serve an apprenticeship in crime. Joining the army is seen as 'an easy way out' and unfortunately, for a lot of recruits, signing up merely delays their reality check by four or so years, by which time they've become bigger, fitter, stronger, but not brighter. Civvy street is daunting, even for those better educated. The cameraderie, shared sense of values: duty, purpose and community are all things inculcated into service personnel. And who better to grasp those qualities than someone from a deprived/underpriviledged background? I think there's a moral responsibilty on the services, as well as a socio-finacial imperative on government, to train service personnel for life after the armed-forces. They all won't leave as Einsteins, but with an emphasis on social skills and values, tied to a reasonable academic standard, at least service retirees would be far better able to cope with 'life on the outside'. I speak as one who, many moons ago left the services after 17 years, only to complete a woefully substandard 'Re-settlement Course' at Catterick Garrison.", I vaguely remember the last government talking about educational help for service people when leaving active service. Did this materialise?," As several posters here have pointed out, ""McNab"" has written a great deal of inaccurate James Bondified nonsense about the regiment and it appears even the civvies are aware that Bravo Two Zero was self-glorifying bullsh1t. (Sorry, radfan , not including you - you were a bootie, so you know more than most.) I don't think anyone should take ""McNab"" too seriously on this or any other subject. Plenty of toms wind up in deep trouble because of PTSD, or whatever you choose to call it, and dismissing it only makes the problem worse."," I find it sad that most contributors to this column feel it necessary to preface their views with a critique of McNab's literary prowess. It has no bearing on his views on the subject under discussion. Kupfernigk, your observation whilst unnecessarily snide in tone, referring to 'operational freedom of a Special Forces NCO' being that of a Major is correct. In some circumstances, operational and tactical considerations make such autonomous decision making a sine-qua-non. Blanket stacker Majors need not apply."," I'm absolutely certain that PTSD does exists and is severely debilitating. Just as back problems are real and damaging. But McNab's view that PTSD is the new bad back has a high degree of plausibility about it.  One would quite reasonably guess that a proportion of PTSD discharges are ""get me out of here"" syndrome.  What can't be judged is if that proportion is very low, very high or somewhere in between. Even more pertinent are the comments about education, preparation for civilian life and returning servicemen to the environments they joined up to escape. I can't judge McNab's reliability as a witness although my own experience of SAS officers does not give me great confidence in it.  That is a shame because the message that we could and should be doing better for ex-servicemen is an important one that shouldn't be dismissed simply because in this instance it comes from a celebrity name of variable reputation. Some 20,000 British military veterans - more than twice the number currently serving in Afghanistan - are in the criminal justice system. That's a disgrace.", people don't think mcnab actually writes those books do they??," Leaving aside all questions about McNab's literary accomplishments and his views on PTSD, there's still the question of what's likely to happen when soldiers with little numeracy or literacy are discharged into civilian life. The hypothesis that the lack of skills is connected with a fairly high frequency of bad outcomes should not be rejected out of hand. It would be reasonable to find out how much truth there is in it, and from the results, see if there are some improvements that could be made. Or perhaps it's so obvious that putting innumerate and illiterate trained killers on the street with no jobs will lead to trouble that we should go directly to trying to prevent it."," Alcohol and his own grossly dysfunctional family background led to the ""character"" of the man who battered my sister and had to be prised away from her by police a couple of months ago.  The fact that he's in the army simply made him more dangerous.  Dependent on legal outcomes, maybe he won't be in a few months."," ""An average reading age within infantry is 11, but the army will recruit from a reading age of seven,"" McNab told the inquiry. "" If I ever read or hear some pompous UK politician or member of the UK armed forces saying, in a semi reverential tone, that 'we have the 'best', 'finest' or 'most professional fighting forces in the world', I would love to be able to show them this quote. How can semi literate people with an average reading age of 11 be allowed to be recruited, armed with deadly weapons, and sent into Afghan villages to 'win the hearts and minds' of people that they haven't the remotest chance of empathising with, or a clue about what they're doing there in the first place? Whether or not the cause in Afghanistan is right, why are we treating a large section of our own educationally failed, young people with such contempt?", Never read anything by Mr McNab before - but there seems to be a quite reasonable point here.  In the US the Army has always been a huge source of social mobility - particularly since WW2.  That's never been true of Britain.  Part of that's obviously the way class works in British institutions - and this neglect of the future of ordinary soldiers while serving is a great illustration.  Providing skills and equipping soldiers for the life after serving is a pretty obvious thing to do....," Mr. McNab's expertise in the finer points of psychiatric medicine are clearly superior to the expertise of all those other medical doctors and nurses, the NHS, all the combined medical services of all our allies and of course, all the combined medical expertise and the experiences of millions of troops over the last 100 years or so."," Is not Johnson Beharry, VC better known?"," In the days of yore, I am sure the armed forces offered recruits academic enhancement such as O Levels and A Levels lorry driving and other vocational skills. Not any more it seems. Is this down to a the fact that successive govts have viewed the armed forces and the common soldiery as little more than someone working in a branch of a DIY Store? I.e. If they they can walk, grunt and move heavy things why do more by way of educating them. This attitude (policy) is also fact in civilian life."," I'm ex military and work at an army training establishment where, as part of their training regime, we try to improve the academic ability and qualifications of trainee soldiers. A lot of these young soldiers are academically poor not because of their ability, but because they've been failed by the national education system - which concentrates on teaching pupils to pass exams rather than to educate them. We really must find a way to motivate young people to want to be literate and numerate as well as encouraging them to become media stars. As for Andy McNab, come on, even his name's a joke - it's rhyming slang for crabs (I've got the Andy McNabs)! But I'm happy if one of my students wants to read a book because it has Andy's name on it - it may be the first book he/she has ever read!  Andy was at our establishment a couple of weeks ago to speak to the soldiers. Aside from all the celebrity palaver, he had a really strong message to send to the soldiers about the importance of education during their military career and, most importantly, after it.Several of them came to the teaching staff after the presentation and asked if we could help them to do more to improve their maths and English skills. They see Andy as someone who' s been where they're going - and so someone worth listening to. After many years of ignoring soldiers' post service careers, the army has, over the past ten years or so, begun to pay more than lip service to educating soldiers during their service; hopefully this help will support soldiers during their inevitable transition from soldier to civilian."," I wonder how many have spoken to discharged Young Soldiers, on my Estate there are quite a few, they are mainly on sickness benefit using PTSD as the excuse, some have been in and out of Prison like a revolving door as it seems the Magistrates after the first offense do not believe them, they are also always bragging to the younger ones what they did in the Army, so I also agree with Andy McNab's statement, most of the ones who join up on my estate do so to get out out, have low esteem and are one step away from Prison anyway, all serve the minimum term or leave while recruits, can't take the discipline, there should always be a means of educating these People while serving, it should always be the case and not used as cannon fodder only."," ""It is starting to be perceived as an honourable excuse for leaving prematurely,"" he said No need for an 'honourable excuse', the services have reduced notice now from 12 months down to 3/4.

When I was at school those who left to join the army were not those who had ever shone academically, far from it.  And my experience of ex- squaddies (through working in the health field) is that there is a tendency not to be able to cope with the complexities of civilian life after many years of not having to make any decisions for themselves.

Those commenters who have noted that these individuals would probably have ended up in prison whether or not they served in the Army are correct.

Reality, as Mr McNab points out, is that the great majority are the poorest and most disadvantaged - and I will assert that being in the current military may actually be safer than being in the environment from which they escaped. I came from such a background myself. At one point in my life, I was the only white boy in my class at school. When I was about 8I saw my first dead person behind a petrol station where he had been robbed and murdered. I joined the (US) military in order to secure the educational benefits, else I had no chance of going to college (I had been on my own since age 15). My plan worked. Today I am a professor of medicine. Very few of those with whom I served took advantage of the benefits offered to them to further their education. When their enlistments expired, they simply returned to the same dead-end situations in which they had been trapped before serving. I have not read any of Andy McNab's works, and have no idea as to their veracity - I do however entirely agree with him that MoD should encourage further education of those serving, and should offer substantive educational benefits to those who have served their term. The goal should be to have someone leave the military with more of an education, with more of an opportunity in life, than when they enlisted. Otherwise all one is doing is taking poorly educated people, teaching them to kill, and then turning them back into society with no other learned skill. However, I entirely disagree with him about PTSD. This is a very real, dangerous, and widely ignored condition. After having served a combat tour as a medic in VietNam it was a decade before I could sleep without having a weapon ready to hand. One day in the operating room a light bulb exploded &amp; I dove under the operating table. Clearly I had PTSD. America's most decorated solider from World War II - Audie Murphy - in retrospect also surely suffered from severe PTSD which lead him to self destructive behavior (in spite of a successful Hollywood movie career) which resulted in grave personal problems. Shell-Shock it was called in those days. Its existence was as denied then as it is now - moreso even."," Firstly, a reading age of 9yrs represents full functional literacy. So bandying about the 11yrs figure is a complete red herring. Secondly I once had a mild versionof the symptoms of PTSD , thankfully only for a few days after witnessing an accident in which someone died. I had no emotional attachment to the people, my life was not in danger in any way and I had a great deal of support available to me. But for a few days I would hear one of the men's voices, not the one who died, saying to me, as he had at the time, 'I'm not going to die am I? as clear as if he was standing behind me, several times an hour, to the point where I would swing round expecting someone to be there!. This would happen unpredicably in meetings ,while driving or going off to sleep. I would also suddenly see the scene again in a flash like a picture ,again while going about my normal day and without daydreaming about it to bring it on. I also dreamt the whole scene over several nights running. I eventually drew the scenes that kept returning and the whole thing stopped. I don't know how I would have stopped it ,if it hadn't stopped on its own. But how different would it be if I'd been in the situation for months rather than a couple of hours, been sleep deprived and frightened to start with, the people involved had been close friends or family and if my own life had been in danger on a daily basis 24-7. It is a most unnerving and debilitating feeling and I wouldn't wish it on anyone. This condition should not be taken lightly and proper diagnosis and treatment should be a given to soldiers coming home from combat. for as long as they need it.", I know nothing about military life but a lot about employability and training and development.  Clearly there is a major problem with military personnel making the transition from a structured and well-defined life in the military against the unstructured civilian way-of- life. Some suggestions: 1.  All military personnel from the day they join should begin preparation for future living and working in civilian life. 2. It should be a legal requirement that the services equip all their recruits with transferable skills so that they can make their living outside of the military. 3.  MOD civilian jobs should be preferentially allocated to ex-service personnel. 4.  The transition from service to civilian work should be planned several years in advance leaving the military.  A variety of mechanisms should be used to assist this transition.  For example why not fill full-time civilian jobs with job-share service personnel for a year or two before they leave.  This would mean that individuals could remain in service jobs for say half of two-thirds of the time but fill the rest of their time in a civilian job-share with our service personnel.," I tend to agree that PTSD is the new ME or back problem. It is very hard to diagnose because background stress levels fluctuate wildly even in the general popoulation based on profession, situation and background. Couple that with the vastly different ways people process and cope with stress, and you have a recipe for overdiagnosis and the inclination to use PTSD as a scapegoat for more complex personality and societal issues. Clearly some major traumas do have a huge impact on some people, whether in the military or not, but some people are better equipped to cope than others, whether through training, education or sheer mental resilience."," Andy Mcnab did not say PTSD did not exist. Similarly, he did not say there was no such thing as a bad back. It is the role that these conditions play or rather the growing mythical role that they play in getting invalided out of work/service. Nobody says PTSD has not made a contribution to the numbers legitimately leaving the army(and subsequently ending up within the penal system). The question that he raises is whether or not it is the whole story."," kupfernigk Don't know if you'll read this, but I'll keep it brief. It seems we're singing from the same hymn sheet. Where we differ, (and I'm not seeking to appear an apologist for McNab), is what some of those wallahs get up to, you really couldn't make up. I realise McNab's raison d'etre is to sell books, therefore he'll glamourise, exaggerate, embelish, (lie) to tell and sell a good story. However, in my service days, I heard a few tales 'first-hand' that would really make your hair curl. None involved the SAS, but rather the more unsung branch of Special Forces, the SBS. Power to your elbow."," I've suffered PTSD, but I was never an army soldier. McNab's main point is probably correct. When I was suffering the illness at its worst I wouldn't have been able to sit in the same room as someone without them thinking that I was going completely round the bend. On a human level, I think the illness exists to remind us things that have happened that are so terrible, so that we make sure we never find ourselves in the same situation again. I guess that's why it's common in soldiers but also exists within the population at large. On the issue of people being signed off as sick. This is something that happens in the population at large as well as in the military. Watching the Daily Politics last week a commentator on the programme told the statistic that 1 in 3 households in the UK now derive half their income from benefits' payments, because they have been signed off sick by the NHS. We are quick to condemn the workshy &amp; benefits scroungers and such like, but this situation where so many people are claiming benefits has only arisen because, in my opinion, doctors / psychiatrists make far too many mistakes."," And just to add to my previous statement, I was told I was schizophrenic by the psychiatrist I went to see. Which is a total load of rubbish."," as an 18 year old back in early eighty's i joined the royal green jackets,one of about 120 recruits in basic training which lasted about 26 weeks .by the end of this time there were about 30 left 25% who passed out and went on to join one of the 3 battalions as qualified infantrymen leaving about 90 that did not about 75% discharged back to civvie street.now it wouldn't take much time for anyone to work out that  75% of the 8500 ex service personnel in prison had served between 1 and 182 days as a recruit only in basic training  leaving The probation service, Napo,es estimates a distortion of true facts and the Howard League for Penal Reform open to criticism for seeking advice from an unaccountable source that many regard as an author of fantasy books  were there are many who would happily provide advice and proof to the public they are what they are"," Bradley46 is making this point in a different way; by the time they leave the Army it is too late. They needed much better and more thorough intervention much earlier on, and they should never have been allowed or encouraged to join up in the first place So we need higher standards in training (not lowering them across the board so that women can pass) and greater rejection of marginal candidates."," What a generalisation! Steve Mitchell may well be correct in that this is the case with some of ex military offenders but to give a blanket dismissal is clearly wrong. As a Falklands veteran I have seen friends die and other who survived the fighting take their own lives. I have seen others who were good soldiers before the war turn into walking disasters on return to the UK. Coincidence? PTSD is not an exact science, it effects different people in different ways and in some cases a desire for excitement, a lack of self worth or simply the effects of close combat may lead them into the spiral of lawlessness. The ex military homeless problem is another symptom of the sausage factory turning and when one reaches the end its goodnight and goodbye followed by a welcome to a world without a support network. As for B20, well done on making the dosh but Vince Philips (I served with him in 3 Commando Brigade) was a fine soldier who didn't deserve his memory and reputation to be trashed by you and Armstrong.

If only Mr. McNab had had the benefit of your advice before going to the Gulf he might have saved himself the trouble and just found himself an agent instead...", Coming from a man who did not complete a full career and also led his patrol into danger as he was a loose cannon.  You're comments are unfounded and naive and display the old type of mentality that still makes it difficult for young men and women to come forward and speak to someone about their problems.," McNab makes several absolutely valid points.  NATO countries really don't treat our new veterans well. The best example of providing opportunity was the USA's GI bill that sent just about any WWII or Korean vet off to college or trade school. Today's professional army recruits from the poor and under-employed neighbourhoods.  McNab is right and many of these bring few skills and schooling with them. NATO countries need to provide these soldiers with more than a GI Bill opportunity. The military would need to run its own literacy and skills training schools.  Many of these soldiers could become excellent tradesmen. About PTSD I think McNab is wrong. There is meta-analysis research on data going back to WWI and WWII  that indicates that after about 220 days in ongoing combat battle hardened soldiers start to be increasingly psychologically unstable. Call it shell shocked, malingering, PTSD they are casualties of war."," Andy McNab (not his real name) is a disgrace and has no right to make comments on ordinary soldiers who find themselves in difficulty.He broke the code of the SAS in writing about his service and I believe has been drummed out of the Regimental Association.His books are works of fiction...purely that..if any of your readers who think he is a hero have heard interviews with other former SAS soldiers you will know that most of what he wrote is made up.Until he donates everything he makes from his books to a forces charity, I have no time for him whatsoever.",empty,empty,empty,empty,empty,empty,empty,empty,empty,empty,empty,empty,empty,empty,empty,empty,empty,empty,2,-1,0,-1,2,0,-1,0,4,-1,3,-1,0,-1,0,-1,3,-1,0,-1,0,0,2,1,0,0,1,-1,0,-1,2,-1,0,0,4,0,1,0,0,-1,0,-1,2,0,-1,0,3,0,3,0,2,0,2,-1,2,0,3,-1,1,0,1,1,3,-1,3,-1,1,0,3,1,0,0,-1,0,2,1,2,-1,2,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,3,0,0,0,1,0,1,-1,2,-1,2,0,0,0,3,1,2,1,-1,-3,-1,-3,-1,-3,-1,-3,-1,-3,-1,-3,-1,-3,-1,-3,-1,-3,-1,-3,-1,-3,-1,-3,-1,-3,-1,-3,-1,-3,-1,-3,-1,-3,-1,-3

Are fashion editors just really stupid?

Charles, by email

Would that it were that simple, but in fact, Charles, there is much more going on here. So when you next see yet another blackface fashion shoot; or yet another one in which models wearing ridiculously expensive clothing cavort gleefully around poor people (so real!); or yet another one that glamorises injured or even dead women, such as the Vogue Italia shoot you cited in your question or the Vice shoot last year recreating the suicides of famous female writers; or yet another one which uses a natural disaster to flog clothes, such as Vogue Italia's notorious oil spill shoot; or one that insists that someone or something deeply inappropriate should be seen as a fashion icon, such as John Galliano's notorious ""homeless chic"" collection, or the claim in Vogue this month that we should all try to dress like Piper Chapman, the incarcerated protagonist of Orange is the New Black – who is not only a prisoner but based on a real person, Piper Kerman (Kerman herself was unimpressed, tweeting simply ""ugh""), rest assured there is much more than mere stupidity going on here.

Instead, these ideas are the product of a complex mathematical equation, one that I will exclusively reveal now: 30% stupidity, 20% ignorance, 10% inability to take anything into consideration beyond mere aesthetics, 10% over-privilege, 30% infantile attention-seeking. It's like learning the recipe to Coca-Cola, isn't it?

There are many glorious things about fashion: the creativity, the excitement of novelty, the thrill of the imagery, the pleasure it can give. But one of the many decidedly unpleasant aspects of it is the way certain parts of the industry confuse an immature desire for controversy with edginess. This is certainly the case with the Vogue Italia shoot that depicts Prada-clad models imitating famous film heroines being threatened with weapons. Chic! Hilariously, the magazine claims that it is not glamorising violence against women – who could ever think such a thing? – but drawing attention to domestic violence so that women who suffer from it ""can feel our nearness"". As the feminist website Jezebel pointed out, survivors of violence might feel the magazine's nearness better if the editor had simply released a statement promising to stop glamorising violence, as opposed to doing precisely that, but how would that help the magazine feature the requisite number of Prada credits? Will somebody please think of the needs of the advertisers here?

The truth is, I feel rather sorry for these fashion editors. Can you imagine how stressful it must be having to shut the oxygen off in your brain enough so that you can come up with these inane ideas every single month? It's just not enough any more to float Angelina Jolie through the Cambodian jungle, getting close to nature while she totes several thousand pounds' worth of Louis Vuitton handbags (SO REAL); you have to think of fashion shoots involving models dogging, as V Magazine did in 2008, or style children like high-end escorts from the 1980s, as Tom Ford did in French Vogue in January 2012. Imagine the stress! And stress causes wrinkles, which are just the worst thing ever, far more so than torture, famine and holocausts. Speaking of all those things, here are some more ideas for controversial fashion shoots to spare fashion editors' complexions:

1. Slave market fashion shoot



Get some white models and black them up. Put them in faux rags, probably by Comme des Garçons and maybe a bit of Marni, too, and build a set of a 19th-century American slave market (12 Years a Slave winning the Oscar has totes made this era have a moment). See if you can get that Lupita chick to feature, for a bit of realism, plus she's so hot right now. Get some famous white dude to act as the auction barker – I'm thinking Russell Brand.

2. Auschwitz fashion shoot

I'm seeing models – extra skinny ones, too, yay! – and I'm seeing barbed wire. Stick the girls in sexily distressed frocks (nipple shots totally acceptable for historical accuracy), ideally by Gucci and Bottega Veneta, but maybe include ones by Jewish designers (Marc Jacobs???) for cultural sensitivity.

3. School shooting fashion shoot



The great thing about this idea is, unlike the slave and Auschwitz shoots, there are many more opportunities to show off accessories here. So, using images from news stories about Columbine High School as the mood board, have two models walking around in trench coats (Burberry, obvs, as classic is always the most tasteful) while they apparently murder their ""classmates"" with guns. Female aggression = hot, and kind of feminist, too, no? School satchels should be shown flying through the air – get ones from Chanel and Mulberry.

4. Rape shoot

Look, rape is a very serious issue and it's time the fashion industry had the courage to draw attention to it. So here we'll just have several pages of photos of models being violently raped. Their clothes – from Prada, Dior and Louis Vuitton, for an edgy, aspirational vibe – will be provocatively torn and stylishly distressed while a male model appears to attack them. We never see the male model's face, but there is always a close-up of the perfectly made-up women's faces as they are raped, really emphasising the horror of the crime – natch – but also to show that being raped does not mean your Bobbi Brown lipstick necessarily needs to smudge.

Soon afterwards management asked that they were taken down as they were inappropriate for such a frosty morning in the windy city, but before that could happen 600 pairs of these Jockey-branded briefs had already been sold. Thirty thousand pairs flew off the shelves in the following three months; pants had changed for ever.

Jockey’s Y-fronts were inspired by a postcard from the south of France showing a young man in a revealing swimsuit. Out of the heady, carefree days between the wars, following on from the decadent jazz bars of Weimar Berlin and the drunken literary salons of 20s Paris, came the Y-fronted underground of 30s Chicago. In the years after the great depression, these tight pants were far more economical with cotton than the wasteful long johns of yore. They were supportive, they were sexy, they were bright icons of modernity.

This Christmas they’re celebrating their 80th birthday, but the world – like so much dirty underwear – has changed. I don’t like Y-fronts at all. I haven’t worn a pair since I was a child, and most likely I never will again. For me they symbolise discomfort, while soft cotton boxers symbolise loose-fitting freedom, a space to express yourself. I just cannot trust a man in Y-fronts, or take him seriously. Cristiano Ronaldo favours a ridiculously tight pair – he even designs them for his CR7 fashion house. But David Beckham prefers a tight boxer, and he knows best, especially since he’s thought to be branching into menswear himself.

Of course, Y-fronts still have their pros: they show off your bulge; they make you look like a superhero; their Y-fronting looks like a peace sign emblazoned between your legs; they offer support.

But they also come with so many cons. They’re just not that comfortable, and some of the more showy models actually offer too much support. One of my old colleagues at i-D magazine bought a pair of Dolce & Gabbana briefs that were moulded around the crotch, and instantly made him appear very well-endowed; however, when he walked out of the house he found they were far too tight, constantly grasping at his manhood like a waxy, cotton octopus. His day at work turned into a traumatic one.

That’s not all: if you’re out of shape, they’re not very flattering; if you’re a flocculent chap, you may need a bikini wax of some sort; and let’s not forget, too-tight Y-fronts have been scientifically proven to decrease your sperm count. Over the years they’ve lost their cool, their inter-war bohemian wonder, and now they’re most associated with Homer Simpson eating donuts and drinking beer on the couch.

Also there’s something sinister about the Y-front, something ungodly; think of Alan Partridge in his leather-posing pouch, lap-dancing for the commissioner of the BBC in a recurring nightmare. In the words of the Urban Dictionary, they are an undergarment characterised by “a ‘Y’ shaped penis-flap at the front, which allows easy access for BJs or golden showers”. It’s all rather seedy. Wearing them, well, you’re only one step away from a thong or, worse, the Towie demi-thong, which wraps gently around your crotch like a crescent moon hiding its dark side.

There’s not much sexy about the Y-front any more, and ever since Calvin Klein’s black-and-white moment in the 90s the underwear world’s fantasies have focused upon tight boxers. Last night, backstage at the Victoria’s Secret fashion show in Earl’s Court, I asked supermodel Doutzen Kroes what sort of look she enjoys on a man and she suggested jogging bottoms, boxers showing above the waistband, and no top at all. So there you go – even multi-millionaire Dutch lingerie models don’t find Y-fronts sexy any more.

Having said all that, if you do wish to indulge yourself in some, why not? Here are three of the more luxurious options for unleashing your inner Adonis.

I actually think briefs are one of the most flattering types of underwear (if you are in shape and have good legs they show them off), and quite useful for support during exercise. On comfort, I think the only real issue is the seams being rough and chaffing on the groin. Trunks/hipsters/Boxer briefs are all good choices too. Interestingly these are underwear typically deemed &quot;acceptable&quot; by society, when they are just as tight as briefs (just with an extra bit of fabric for the legs). It seems a rather Victorian sentiment to suggest these are more appropriate, or that y-fronts/briefs somehow cause alarm or distress. Traditional loose boxers on the otherhand are neither flattering, practical or comfortable (unless you enjoy them sat up at your waist or riding up places they shouldn't be riding up).

Melania Trump by Regine Mahaux (2017)



A gushing blurb beside Melania Trump’s portrait, released yesterday on the White House website, reminds us that the former model has “worked with some of the top photographers in the fashion industry”. Apparently, none of them were available for this commission. That honour fell to Regine Mahaux, whose past work includes the Vanity Fair Trump shoot in which Barron, Melania and Donald lark around in a golden apartment. As a statement of the administration’s grasp on modernity, this latest photograph is only slightly less terrifying. The first lady’s crossed arms and assertive stance are pure X Factor judge circa 2007 – a depressingly logical setup for America’s first reality TV presidency. The use of soft focus is even weirder. Gently blurred photography is very hip at the moment, as seen in the nostalgic atmosphere of Juergen Teller’s spring/summer 2017 campaign for Céline and throughout Kim Kardashian’s artfully ironic social media channels. Here, the vaseline-on-the-lens look swerves those associations and appears simply to have been retrieved from a time capsule buried somewhere around 1980.

Michelle Obama by Joyce N Boghosian (2009)

A classic example of Obama’s gift for visual branding. She’s smiling, she’s unguarded, she’s welcoming us into her White House world. She’s supporting an American designer – Michael Kors – in a modern sleeveless shift-dress with the establishment-pleasing addition of a double-string of pearls. Difficult to fathom it now, but this portrait caused quite the furore at the time because Flotus was baring her arms. (Clearly, in 2009 we didn’t have enough to worry about.)

Laura Bush by Krisanne Johnson (2005)

Flowers are a recurring motif of official first lady photography; they have clear symbolic meaning, given the role’s traditional preoccupation with stereotypically feminine “soft power” duties. (For what it’s worth, Jacqueline Kennedy was the first to hire a dedicated florist for the White House; Eleanor Roosevelt wasn’t that bothered about them.) This photograph is, indeed, soft – and twinkly; it’s first lady as friend to the nation, relaxing in a chair, one eyebrow raised inquisitively in the manner of Jessica Fletcher in Murder She Wrote.

Hillary Clinton by Jeffrey Markowitz (1994)

More freshly arranged flowers in the background, although Clinton wasn’t one to give up her career to host teas and bake cookies; this picture came not long after the backlash sparked by her famous remarks to that effect. It’s a great shot. Her gaze is steady; her smile is confident, capable, kind. Surely this is what a president looks like?

Barbara Bush by David Valdez (1989)

Having been not just Flotus and Slotus (second lady, wife of the vice-president), but also Mopotus (mother of the president; OK, I made that one up), Barbara Bush is as establishment as they come. She played a traditional, supportive first-lady role; so reluctant was she to take centre stage that an official solo portrait from her White House days has proved difficult to come by. But we do have this. Bush was famously uninterested in fashion, nevertheless her clothes convey status, money and power: the creamy dress, the pearls, the bobby dazzler of a diamond earring.

Nancy Reagan (1981)

There was nothing hip about Nancy Reagan back in the day – not even when she hung out with Zammo from Grange Hill – but, amazingly enough, this is the most fashion-forward of all the official first-lady shots. That blouse is pure new-era Gucci; the mid-length skirt precedes next season’s soft-power silhouette. Reagan’s clasped-hand stance is all unassuming friendliness; the wide crop – including the red-walled, gilded room – suggests she is neither cowed by, nor ashamed of, the grandeur that surrounds her. It’s aesthetically pleasing. But does that make her cool?

No one who is nearly 47 has absolutely no lines on their face even if they have had multiple facelifts and gallons of expensive face cream endlessly poured on their face.

But not all of the clothes being returned to major retailers will be unworn. According to a survey, a fifth of shoppers admit to buying items with the intention of wearing them and then returning them. “Wardrobing” is estimated to cost UK retailers £1.5bn, and they are increasingly clamping down on the practice: earlier this year, the online retailer Asos announced it would blacklist serial returners. We took to the streets of London to find out how common wardrobing really is – and whether the retailers should be worried.

I never shop online personally; I like to go to shops and try things on. My wife sells clothes at Spitalfields market, and when you’re a small retailer who only has one of each size in stock, wardrobing would be a nightmare. But I don’t know about a ban on it. We live in a wonderful free-market economy, don’t we? People wouldn’t accept it. They’d prefer to have someone out there being paid peanuts to make clothes and deliver them, without thinking too much about it.

I do the opposite. I buy things all the time and I can’t be bothered to return them. Wardrobing isn’t right anyway, so I wouldn’t do it. It’s not very nice. I feel sorry for the companies, but I don’t think you should be banned from returning things if you do it too often. Sometimes you get stuff and you really don’t like it, and you do need to return it. There are some brands now that put the tag on the outside so you can’t wear things and take them back. Other brands should just do that.

Lately I have tried to get into the habit of shopping on the app Depop, or doing charity shopping, because of how bad fast fashion is for the environment, so I don’t wardrobe. I am trying to make more of a conscious effort not to consume as much, which is difficult because everything is so readily available on the internet. I don’t think you should be banned from returning things. It would be an issue for me because I like to take things home and see how they look.

I have never done wardrobing, but I have friends who do. And stylists who I have worked with on shoots do it. They’ll order clothes for the model to wear and then return them. But I’m too lazy to take things back. I really am! Seriously, though, it doesn’t seem right. People get their picture taken in the clothes, and then send them back. Imagine if everyone did that.

I’ve heard of someone who does it – she even has a special gun to put the tags back on. She’ll buy a nice dress for an event, wear it once, and then send it back. I have no idea where she got the gun from. I guess you could say she’s a professional wardrober. I don’t like the idea of people doing it, though. I wouldn’t want to receive something that had been worn by someone else. I actually always check my clothes when I buy them, to check there are no signs of wear.

I don’t do that. Maybe I’m old-fashioned, but I like to buy my clothes and see that they fit and keep them for a good amount of time. Wardrobing must have a big carbon footprint: it’s very wasteful. But I guess that’s just the fashion industry in general. We have lost the worth of the actual labour behind what we buy. We never keep anything. My mum used to fix my socks when we were little, but no one does that now.",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2019/sep/18/is-wardrobing-ever-acceptable-shoppers#comments," My former mother-in-law used to do this back in the 1980s. She bought stuff from Marks &amp; Spencer for special occasions &amp; took it back afterwards. They must have known she'd worn the clothes as she was a heavy smoker yet they didn't challenge her. I was pretty shocked when she told me but, as she saw it, if the shop was letting her get away with it they deserved to be exploited. Not a flicker of guilt.", Before heading over to the UK former colleague of mine worked in a department store in Australia. An item was brought back into store as it had been gifted and when worn by the recipient brought her out in hives. Long story short it turns out it had been returned by a previous customer who had used it to dress her embalmed mother for an open coffin. Takes ‘wardrobing’ to a whole new level., One of the reasons this happens is because the retailers tolerate it to a large extent. My daughter worked for an online retailer in their call centre and she told me about the brazen cheek of many customers who returned items that were clearly worn and soiled. The retailer would not refuse a refund to the customer because they were scared of losing future sales from that customer.," As a small shop owner I only had one person who did this blatantly - first time I refunded although I knew that the hole in the garment been caused by her. Second time I barred her from the shop for life. Don’t need customers like her thank you very much. It is a problem caused by the big retailers who didn’t follow Trading Standards year’s ago and foolishly allowed refunds for everyone no matter what the circumstances and as if this was “good” customer service. This got out of control in recent years. Refunds are given if the product is faulty or not fit for purpose - this is the actual law. I certainly don’t refund the person who decides a week later that they don’t like what they bought! And seriously, I’m happy to lose that type of customer.", We had 14 t-shirts brought from our small online shop and then 1 week later a return request for all 14. We traced the sellers facebook account and they had posted photos of them all wearing them at a small concert. Suffice to say a threat of police action made the return request go away," Well, it isn't only high street shops, I work in a charity shop and believe me customers do this regularly. Usually it is a higher priced item, something posh for a wedding or other special occasion, then after the even they bring it back for a refund. Once a man brought back a black suit, shirt and tie, that he had bought for a funeral, it reeked of booze and cigars and had food stains on it, on this occasion we refused the refund but he kicked up one hell of a fuss. We do insist that the price tag is still attached to such items or they can't be refunded but customers get round it somehow, I can only imagine they tuck the price tag out of the way whilst wearing it, or as has been said in the article, they have access to a gun and put the price tag back on. I think it is wrong, not only in charity shops but more generally, it displays a sense of entitlement and privilege indicative of a throw away society.", I think you're as likely to find someone who admits to doing this as finding one of those people who hang up bags of dog poo in bushes.," The very concept is disgusting. It is a moral black hole and I sincerely hope none of my friends ever did it. If someone confessed to me that they were ""wardrobing"" at a party, I might deliberately spill tomato ketchup on them to ensure they couldn't cheat the seller. I am not a flag-waver (I am a Remoaner, a republican, a believer in equality, a despiser of capitalism...) but I think one of the things I want to be proud of, regarding the UK, is that we're honest. Or try to be.", The answer to that question is a clear: NO, It’s a cheap and mucky thing to do. Gross.," If brands sorted out their sizing then they wouldn't get so many returns the amount of times I have bought clothes in the same size apparently, only to have them fit differently means that I have to return a lot of things. More people suffer from that than 'wardrobing'."," Very shocking. People actually do this? It's a thing?? Absolutely bloody wrong. Criminal, nasty, selfish, wrong on every conceivable level. Have people no shame? It's never even occurred to me once in my life to commit such an underhand act. I would never even have thought of such a scam, on my own. What do people do - sit at home rubbing their hands and dreaming up how they can rip other people off? Where the hell is the morality in that. That would make me feel depressed about myself. I'd realise I was very fucked up and would feel awful. People don't feel shame?? They think it's perfectly OK? They don't mind behaving like scumbags? Glad to read here of people who don't and wouldn't. But learning that people do cheat and scam in this way has been a dispiriting read. Wow."," So... nobody does it, but some people know somebody who does it sometimes?"," I pointed out a tag on a top to a girl at work, and she said she was going to return it so didn't take the tag off. We worked for a clothing retailer with a wardrobing problem. Some people are just idiotic trash."," Years ago I worked on customer services desk at M&amp;S. They used to be very generous and give full refunds if you had a receipt or a credit voucher if you didn’t. Of course people abused the system, many a wedding hat returned with cake/lipstick on it, deodorant caked under the arms of dresses, but the worst of all was having to check the underwear .... yes, some people repacked their 5 packs. Utterly vile"," ""My mum used to fix my socks when we were little, but no one does that now"" I do! Darning a little hole in the toe is dead easy and I wear through the toes so quickly I reckon it increases a sock's lifespan tenfold. More people should learnt to darn, darn it!"," These people are scammers so why pussy-foot around their crime and say they are engaged in some kind of benign activity called ""wardrobing""? They are on exactly the same level as insurance scammers and we all shun those people. Even the fall-out is the same: industry loses money (£1.5 billion in the case of the clothing retailers according to the article) and the losses are then passed onto the honest consumers whose prices/premiums rise. It's scamming (theft by deception) no matter which way you look at it.", It'll be like the old dog shit or litter debate. Everyone finds it reprehensible but seemingly no-one will actually admit to it," I think it's dishonest, immoral, and cheap."," We took to the streets of London We took to the tiny bit around Kings Cross station, just next to the office.", It's a shoddy practice. I'd sooner avoid squeezing into a dress that someone else's arse has been in.," This isn't new. I had this when I worked in a department store 20 years ago. A group came in, could barely speak English, but knew the word refund. The clothes were very old and dirty. I was a temp on my own, I told them no chance. They tried everything, I wasn't having any of it. I think it's wrong. Retailers are already struggling to survive as it is."," Please dont do this its dishonest and it is fraud. People think they can do this wash the item and return it, but they always smell of soap. We just just reject any return that smells of soap"," It’s amazing how filthy people are and how stupid they think retail staff are. There’s been many a time that I’ve had to politely ask a customer how a snot rag/cloakroom ticket managed to get in the pocket of their trousers that they only took off all the labels to ‘try on’ before realising (several hours?) later that they don’t fit. Urgh, and the suspicious stains. It’s like they think no one else ever goes commando. I can imagine that returning stuff they bought online reduces the shame factor. Not that they really care anyway.", It’s like voting Tory. No one is going to admit it., I think the shops are missing a trick. What about a 'clothes library'?, Let’s all discuss how to excuse petty theft as victimless crime., Wardrobing is a shameful symptom of greed and selfish unconcern for others or for the environment. I wish companies would act more harshly against these cheats.," When returning clothes even for a legitimate reason it is always a good idea to check them before handing them over. Once, when returning some tights on behalf of my wife, I failed to notice that our cat had been sleeping on them, leaving the gusset caked in fur. The look on the sales assistant’s face would have been hilarious if I wasn’t so mortified by the situation. I know this sounds like a joke with an obvious double entendre in the punchline but it actually happened."," It's certainly not new, but it's still horrible. I have a very low opinion of people who do that. I was a bridesmaid years and years ago, and we got our dresses from a catalogue. The other two bridesmaids returned their dresses. I sold mine, for a pittance, and got criticized by the other two for not having returned it! When I buy things, if I decide afterwards that they aren't for me, I either return them, having done no more than try them on, or I keep them and give them away. I can't imagine returning something worn, and I'd be very unhappy to buy something for full retail and find that it had been worn. But I buy a lot of my clothes via eBay these days, and catalogue returns can be great bargains!", I wish a non refundable skid mark upon all Wardrobers.," I find it odious, and the honest shoppers pay the price.", Of course it's not acceptable. I can't believe people have sunk so low.," Years of clothing retail work and I would see this all the time. Anyone who thinks of returning worn clothes, without fault, for a refund, should ask themselves if they are happy to pay full price for for an item that is dirty, stretched, smells of fags, or sweat or food or perfume or even fabric softener, because washing the item might clean it but it is immediately obvious because no new clothing smells like that. Or covered in dog hair or looking like it's been scrunched up in the boot of your car for a month. If refunds are given for items like this for 'goodwill' then that is a money loss to the retailer. And just like theft, that cost gets fed back to the consumer."," It is done by the sort of cheapskates who would not tip a waitress , ypu are either honest or dishonest by nature"," How on earth do they keep the clothing clean enough to return? I'm a messy eater &amp; clumsy with liquids. Some of my clothes have to be destroyed because of terminal staining. I'm full of admiration for the person who doesn't sweat, spill, bleed or ooze on a night out"," Has anyone looked at what other people are wearing ( as well as yourself, your work colleagues, your friends and your family) as you are walking along the road, sitting at a bus stop, driving your car, people in shopping malls and in restaurants in cafes and in bars , theatres and the cinema ? Any where you go basically ? Take a real long hard look ... Most people are so badly( and scruffy and yes over weight) dressed it is unbelievable and yet there are amazing clothes out there for sale so who buys them and where do they wear them and when ? Thats what online buying does as well as shopping tv channels ... how can people possibly tell if the style, cut , size and colours suit you and how can you tell the cut and the quality of the material with out feeling it and trying it on. Most People these days are like sheep with no flair, originality or imagination and look a mess and quite frankly I wouldn’t been seen in what they are wearing taking my rubbish to my wheely bin . Please try the clothes on before you buy ... old fashioned idea but it works."," Buy a few clothes you like that are good quality. Wear them a lot. Stop shopping, you’re driving yourself crazy and adding to the bonkers narcissism of the exploitative fashion industry.", I still fix (darn) socks. And I occasionally 'turn' the collar on my husband's favourite shirts. But wardrobing has been going on for decades. I was a Saturday girl at a department store (picture Grace Brothers) in the 1970s and horrified to learn that the manager of the ladies' department would borrow a posh dress for the weekend," I buy all my clothes in person and try them on first, so I have no need to do this, but TBH it's a pretty rare occasion when something I've bought has come out of its first wash and ended up still feeling brand new. I'm convinced that there is some ""chemical"" in clothes that make them feel amazing when you try them on only for them to turn dull and lifeless when they come out of the wash.", Why is the guardian using some twee hipster word for what is theft. Call a spade a spade., My friend is attending her brother's wedding next weekend. The other week she brought in 3 outfits to show me for my opinion. I wasn't surprised that each was neatly in its bag with tags attached but I was surprised that she had every intention of returning all three outfits and part of her decision was based on how easy it was to hide/remove the tags! I suppose that it's up to retailers to tighten up their policies. This isn't new and only associated with online retailer; my friend shopped at proper stores and I remember doing something similar 30 years ago.," It has never occurred to me, to send for clothes wear them and then return them for a refund, it seems immoral. Bu I would hate to see returns been banned. I am a full time carer and it is difficult to get out and go shopping for clothes. I am also 5ft 10 and take a size 8 - 10 so shopping for clothes that actually fit is not easy. I shop on line and will frequently send for several items and return whatever, does not fit, or does not suit me. I also find that sometimes fabric and quality are not as good as the price would indicate so they go back as well. So I guess that I could easily be labelled a serial returner. If on line stores start to refuse returns my ability to shop, not only for clothes, but 90% of all I buy would be seriously limited.", It is akin to theft and I hope the shops clamp down on it. Those of us who don't do it end up paying more because the returned stuff can't be sold anymore and is a loss which gets passed on - or we end up with 'new' things which aren't new., You can purchase security strips that go all the way through the clothing items and are sealed with a void if removed hologram end. The buyer can try the item on but would look like a right plank wearing it out, There’s a shop in Copenhagen which rents things for a few pounds a day. Perhaps clothes retailers need to branch into this., Just another example of people behaving in a rubbish and immoral way. We all pay for it in the end.," I've bought stuff from charity shops (my tailor of choice) and sometimes have taken stuff back a few months later. (if they haven't degenerated into work clothes and are thus only fit for the bin). Does this count as ""wardrobing""? I do hope so as I am so rarely on trend."," This has been a problem for years. I've seen signs in John Lewis in Liverpool by the hats at Grand National time saying they will not under any circumstances take any hats back after the day if tags have been removed (and the tags are placed on the front so they are really noticable). If retailers are so bothered, they should place conspicuous tags on the front of all their clothes, rather than placing tags through the label. I think Coast do it already. That woman with her own gun is an exception, most people just wouldn't be bothered to do it anymore. Problem solved."," It's difficult not to buy clothes cos they're so easily available online? Er, ok. Somehow I manage it. Fast fashion isn't obligatory.", The last dude nailed it - think of the carbon footprint of plastic packaging and transport. This is very selfish behaviour., Thieves," A friend managed a shop and this was suspected of some customers, a lot new clothes bought every Friday and returned Monday. Until that weekend when the customer bumped into my friend out, in her new outfit - didn't return that one!"," If we want retailers to stay in business so we can continue to have the choice to buy from them, it would help if people didn't shoplift, over-order in many sizes online, and wear things with the intention to return them. I don't want to know anyone who does this, as regardless of income, it is dodgy, unhygienic and dishonest. Keep your sweat for your own clothes, not the ones I am going to buy!"," There seems to be some ambiguity in the definition. Is this buying online, then changing your mind and sending it back, or buying it, wearing it, and then returning it? The first one is fine. Sometimes you change your mind, it doesn’t fit, or looks different online. I’m an unusual shape so I frequently do this as I can’t tell from photos how it’ll look on me. The second one is dishonest and entitled. It should definitely not be allowed. If you’ve worn it and no longer want it, give it to charity or sell it."," I don't wardrobe (who actually would do this??) but I do return a lot of clothes after buying as I often only get an opportunity to try them on at home (no time to try on clothes during shopping). Also, when ordering clothes online i find that the sizes are so non standard that I need to return about 50% probably. I'd really struggle if shops made it more difficult to return items. I think putting the tags on the outside so that they can't be worn before returning is a better idea..."," “Wardrobing” is estimated to cost UK retailers £1.5bn, It makes complete sense to discriminate against those who abuse the system (who pays that £1.5Bn? Other customers!) However, if retailers wanted to effectively prevent people returning clothes they have already used they would have a prominent sticker loosely sewn to a garment. It would contain a message that left nobody in any doubt that the wearer was freeloading off other customers. The sellers would then be within their rights to refuse a refund if the sticker was missing. Afterthought: can I return any unused food to the supermarket if I decide not to eat it?"," Putting the label on the outside does seem a good idea. That way, customers can try the clothes on but if they cut the label off in order to wear them then they can’t be returned."," My wife is always buying clothes on-line to try on - most of which she returns because the fit or colour are not right. It gives her great pleasure that she would miss if companies clamped down, as she is no longer fit enough to wander up and down the high street shops."," Ive recently taken to fixing my socks. You can extend a sock""s life by around 4 months. F fast fashion.", Interesting that none of the interviewees is wardrobing but all of them know someone who does it.," Had a colleague who boasted that, when she worked as a window dresser, she would regularly take stock home and then return it to the hanging rails after wearing it. This was common practice. She was surprised that I wasn't amused. So, check everything before you buy it - even in retail outlets."," I once ordered a dress that arrived smelling of perfume and wee. By the time it arrived it had sold out, so I washed it and kept it, but what sort of person returns a garment in that state?", Happened in the 1980s when I had a Saturday job in a well known fashion chain (still going) - only it was the - generally teenage - staff who would take 'borrow' stuff for a Saturday night and return on Monday. I was too scared of getting the clothes dirty and my wages docked. Like the one time I borrowed a friend's posh frock for a wedding and spent the evening avoiding anyone with a glass of red wine or plate of greasy food. Not worth it., Never even heard of this. I have never done this and never would.," To play devil's advocate for a moment: Stores know this happens, and they don't change their policies, because they decide that the extra sales generated by a generous refund policy outweigh the abuse. Note the twice-repeated comment by people interviewed: they're too lazy to return stuff they don't like. Stores to a large extent bank on this when making decisions about having a generous return policy. Money-back guarantees are the same; for every person who does ask for a refund, there are 2 or 5 or 10 who bought the product thinking ""there's no risk, I can always return it!"" who then never gets around to actually doing so. This is a business decision based on dollars and cents, so there's arguably no real victimization; it's a calculated choice and there's little reason to feel bad for the business about it. That said, it is obviously subject to change - if enough leechers start abusing the policy, eventually it won't be worth keeping any more, and it'll be done away with or made stricter. In other words, it's not really the stores we should feel sorry for here - the danger is to other customers, who may find generous return policies going away, to their detriment, because of the actions of the wardrobers who end up ruining it for everyone.", I suspect women do it more than men.

Cynthia, by email

The short answer to your question, Cynthia, is yes, mos def, and we'll get to the whys and whens of this in two shakes of a lamb's tail. First, however, I need to deal with your self-deprecating hashtagging.

It will come as an enormous shock to absolutely no one that a fashion column has no truck with the particularly tedious phrase ""first-world problems"". It is invariably used by the same type of people who write comments such as, ""YEAH, WHATEVER, WHAT ABOUT SYRIA?!?!?!?"" underneath online fashion articles – in other words, people who mistake obtuse self-righteousness for depth. I'm not going to deal with the online commenters here because, frankly, that might deprive me of the weekly pleasure of yelling back at them below the line. But in regards to the ""first-world problems"" snark, it doesn't seem too outrageous that those lucky enough to live in the first world will have occasional first-world problems. This, I believe, is what is called life. For heaven's sake, what other kind of problems would first-worlders have? If someone who lived in, say, Oxford complained that their local Waitrose was shutting down, this would strike me as par for the course. If this same Oxonian announced they were suffering from terrible starvation due to the cruelties of an invading warlord, I would be somewhat flummoxed.

Because there is trouble in Syria, it doesn't mean that folks in this country now wander the streets saying: ""What shall I cook for dinner tonight? Did I pick up the dry cleaning? Oh, WHO CARES, WHAT ABOUT SYRIA?!?!?!?"" One can be aware of terrible situations but still have personal concerns. Similarly, just because one is lucky enough to live in a country that isn't ravaged by war and famine does not mean that one's life is niggle-free. You can appreciate the comfort of your life but still get irritated when the cashpoint gives out a single £50 note instead of the far more useful combination of two £20s and a £10, and that doesn't make you Marie Antoinette. In any event, someone sneering ""First-world problems!"" is not going to make anyone think, ""By God, they're right! I really must spend less time on asos.com and more time thinking about Syria."" Rather, they'll think, ""Bog off, you self-righteous numpty"", and go right back to looking at Asos. So not only does the phrase make no sense, but it is also totally pointless, other than to warm the inner sanctimony of those who utter it.

So what I'm saying, Cynthia, is: do not apologise for noticing that high fashion has suddenly got a lot more expensive. You occasionally splash out on something pricey? That's nice, lucky you. Yes, there are tonnes of nice non-designer things, but that doesn't mean one needs to prostrate oneself in shame for buying designer things. I don't hear too many football fans out there saying: ""You know, those Chelsea season tickets are so expensive. It's disgusting that people buy them when they could watch a local school's team play in the park for free.""

But to your question, at last. Yes, designer goods have gone up an insane amount of late. According to a recent Wall Street Journal report, Chanel bags have gone up by 70% in the past five years, Jimmy Choo shoes have gone from $495 to $650 in the same time, and Mulberry has merrily hiked up the prices on its bags. It has now got to the point where I am genuinely amazed if I see a designer handbag in a magazine that has less than a four-figure price.

There are two reasons for these price rises. First, because designers know they can do it. They no longer have to aim for the middle-class woman who wants to treat herself occasionally to a £500 bag – now they're aiming for the phenomenally wealthy from Russia, China, and the Middle East as well as the one-percenters at home.

Second, because these labels want to look elite, and the easiest way to do that is to give their products elite prices. We've seen this before with Miu Miu, which used to be Prada's relatively affordable younger brand but is now nearly as expensive as the older label. In that case, the strategy worked – not for me, as I can no longer even afford a pair of Miu Miu tights, but it did work for the brand, which is seen as a high-fashion player. But it doesn't always: Bruno Guillon, Mulberry's chief executive at the time, encouraged the raising of prices in order to make Mulberry ""a global luxury brand"" akin to Hermès, which is where he worked before. Yet it turned out that it takes more than high prices to make a customer want a bag, and while elitism and exclusivity are desirable qualities in the fashion world, they're less appealing if they actually mean nobody is buying the products. Profits plunged and Guillon exited stage left last month.

I – you, again, will not be too surprised to learn – love fashion but I absolutely hate feeling ripped off, and the trick when buying high fashion is to find the precise price that reflects your love of the objects. If the price is more than your love, as it increasingly is these days, walk away. And then walk right over to your wardrobe and flog off some of your old designer bags, as they're worth an absolute bomb now, and you can buy a new one. See? That's economics. And you all thought fashion wasn't as important as Syria.

But if I bought my wife a 500 quid bag, then I suspect she would divorce me for wasting money. And divorce, ironically, can be very expensive."," Life's a fucking nightmare sometimes, aint it?"," Robin Williams, when he was still funny, used to say that cocaine was God's way of telling you you're making too much money. A handbag with a four-figure price tag should fulfil the same purpose: shame any potential purchaser into realising that something has gone terribly wrong with life on earth. But it doesn't, does it? As these greedy little piggies glide, gimlet-eyed, through the corridors of Selfridges and Harrods, they never seem to think, '£1999 for a handbag? What the hell's going on?' Rather the rationale seems to be 'Yes. I need that. It will doubtlessly reflect well on me as person and make others think highly of me.' So when is there going to be a revolution, please? Because, by crikey, we are surely getting perilously close to the stage where the great howling injustice of this state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue.", Jimmy Choo shoes have gone from $495 to $650 So they risen from unaffordable to... unaffordable?," Its not just in fashion - I'm a bit of a bike nut and I've noticed the past couple of years a huge increase in the price of the pimpier end of the market and a whole range of once mid-market brands seeming to battle each other to be the most expensive. I think there are two reasons: First is our old friend growing inequality. 10 years ago the sure fire way for top brands to make money was to make their products 'just about' affordable for the masses - so they introduced lines carefully priced to be a 'treat' for the average working person. But it seems the average working person now can't afford such treats (witness the huge growth for the Primarks and Aldi's of the retail world compared to the old mid-market brands). So now the prime market has shifted to the growing financial clout of the 1%ers. And of course many of those 1%ers aren't always very bright - they think the more expensive it is, the better (as anyone who has ever bought whiskey for Chinese businessmen will attest). The second one, as any marketer with a psychology degree will tell you, is that we are very bad at judging 'value' in absolute terms - we always subconsciously rate something as 'cheap' in relation to other products, not in terms of the absolute value of that product. Its an old trick by many companies to continually hike the price of their 'premium' product in order to fool us into thinking that their 'standard' product is good value. I wouldn't be surprised to find out if nowadays some of the biggest profits for those companies are from their factory outlets - people think they are getting 'value', when they are still paying a grossly inflated figure next to production costs."," Just go to another shop, buy a bag that looks the same and is at least 50% of the price, also well made, just doesn't have the label on it. Why the obsession with labels? A guy at work bought his girlfriend a Burberry handbag, when he gave it to her she frantically opened it and checked it all over to make sure it was real. I find it hard to believe she would have liked it if it hadn't been designer (it was brown, boring, and quite ugly). I enjoy fashion but don't buy something because is is designer."," Dear Hadley, they become more expensive because more and more little Indian, Thai and Chinese hands are now handling pencils and schoolbooks.

I preferred their floating docks.," Designer fashion has never been cheap, and part of the fun of it (as an observer) is the fantasy of it all. I love fashion editorial spreads where they list the prices, in Vogue or the NYTimes T mag. &quot;Chanel chiffon blouse, $12,000.&quot; That sort of thing, it amuses me to no end. Ten years ago there were these golden Balenciaga (I think) tights that made a woman look like C-3PO from the waist down. They were actually fantastic-looking, then you read they cost $20,000. For tights! You cannot help but marvel at the ballsiness of the pricing. Fashion's dirty little secret used to be: no one actually pays the full price listed in editorials in Vogue, say. The number was there to impress, but even very rich women in New York or London wouldn't ever pay that full price. But now, as the point of Hadley's article here points out, there are rich women from different parts of the world, new wealth, who will pay full price, no questions asked. It's kind of fascinating."," The thing I don't get about &quot;designer&quot; stuff is, surely everything is designed? Or do the trainers I buy in Primark just spontaneously appear out of thin air?"," &quot;the trick when buying high fashion is to find the precise price that reflects your love of the objects.

Its the same with the &quot;what about the menz!?!?!&quot; feminist reactionary crowd.

They are all ludicrously overpriced, some are overtly vulgar, others are just plain ugly. I have a couple of friends who are very much into these things. As penniless college students, we used to go to this shop that sold 'Class A' copies of Louis Vuitton, Chanel, and Ferragamo and their eyes would literally glaze over as they lovingly held this little purse and cuddled that oversized tote. All I saw were counterfeit, ugly plastic bags. My friends are now gainfully employed and have graduated to the real thing. While I don't judge their predilection for these ridiculously expensive accessories (it's their money, after all), I do wonder what fuels their lust. I once read a book that delves into this 'It bag and luxury goods' phenomenon. It's called Deluxe: How Luxury Lost its Luster by Dana Thomas. It was an interesting peek into the otherworldly realms of the biggest fashion houses, their $1,000/piece denim bags and their $2/day labourers. There was a chapter about people whose unhealthy attitude towards these goods border on insanity, like the Japanese woman who sleeps in a shoe box, surrounded by her collection of Channel and Louis Vuitton bags and the man who uses Ferragamo handkerchief (if I recall right) to carry his Ferragamo leather case, lest he damages the leather handles with his sweaty palms. It was unsettling, at the very least. I live in the Philippines, where the poorest subsist on Php 6,000 ( USD 135) a month, or Php 200 (roughly USD 5 ) a day.

Marcus, by email





There are three parts to your question, Marcus, and I’ll try to answer them each fairly, politely and without punching myself in the face. So, what’s “the point” of fashion week? Well, the point is that it allows designers to show their clothes to stores that decide whether or not to buy them. This is what’s called “running a business”. It is also so designers can show their collections to journalists who then write about them for people who are interested. From your tone, I gather you are not interested, Marcus, but one of the many strange things about life is that not everyone is interested in the same things. I, for example, could not give a single fig about sport, and yet I do not spend my time leaving comments beneath articles about the European Championships such as: “What is the point of this????? Boring!!!!! Look at all these overpaid idiots!!!!” as some folk are wont to do beneath articles about fashion. When I hear people talk about how excited they are about, I don’t know, Arsenal, I don’t run up to them bellowing: “But why?! None of us will ever be able to play like that so why is anyone wasting their time watching this rubbish?” I accept that some people like to watch a bunch of men kick a ball around a field on a rainy day, and I get on with the far more important activities in my life, such as styling my dog’s hair so that he resembles Andrew Ridgeley, or deciding who I fancy more, 1986 James Spader in Pretty in Pink or 1990 James Spader in White Palace (impossible decision, but one I plan to ponder for the rest of my life).

The reason people feel free to dismiss fashion with a “what’s the point” in a way that no one ever would about sport, or theatre, or film, or Apple product launches, is because fashion is aimed at women. Thus, it is, apparently, totally legitimate to dismiss it as frivolous. Silly little ladies and their lady things! Not important like kicking a ball, you see.

Your next point is slightly separate, although it is often used by fashion sceptics as an excuse for their loudly voiced dislike of the industry. Yes, the clothes are expensive and made for a minority. You could say the same of, say, theatre tickets, to say nothing of Apple products with their inbuilt obsolescence. Regarding the size issue, there is no question that the clothes are shown on indefensibly thin models. But to say that fashion is therefore irrelevant to bigger women, or even most women, is to let the idiotically sizeist designers win. Fashion is for everyone, and just because some ridiculous stylist who has destroyed their brain cells by reading only Vogue for 15 years thinks clothes “hang better” on an underweight eastern European teenager doesn’t mean that’s true. Any woman can look at the runways and get inspiration, such as how good your striped jumper would look with your metallic long skirt from Zara (thanks, Gucci, for that one) or how flat boots would look amazing with a floaty dress (ta, Victoria Beckham). Fashion shows aren’t just telling women to buy specific clothes – they show women how to wear clothes in more modern, often fun, ways. To say that fashion week is irrelevant to most women is to be on the same side as the idiot designers and stylists who think anyone over a size 10 should be happy wearing a burlap sack.

Finally, you ask why all the coverage, and this is the fairest question of all. Because the truth is, fashion week is just a big ol’ trade fair, one for industry insiders and die-hard fans. And yet, trade fairs for, say, cars, houses or even guns, get nothing like the coverage gifted to the various fashion weeks around the world. The reason is, of course, that fashion weeks generally involve more models than house shows, and the media will jump on any opportunity to run a photo of a pretty, young, thin fashion model. Double points if these photos are then accompanied by an article tutting at how pretty, young and thin the model is, thereby allowing the newspaper to exploit the attention-grabbing images while reclining on the moral high ground.

This is one of the many situations in life where no one is right, really, yet people want to believe otherwise. Fashion shows do use models who are too thin, and this has become an absurd and intractable issue. On the other hand, fashion is an industry aimed at women, largely staffed and run by women. No one can celebrate fashion shows as a terrific feminist event. At the same time, no one should entirely damn them. Fashion shows reside very much in a grey area of morality, but one thing you cannot say about them is that they are uninteresting. If you do find them so, I have a very simple piece of advice, one I’ve learned after living through decades of football tournaments: don’t read about them.",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/sep/19/whats-the-point-of-london-fashion-week#comments, What often gets lost is what a bloody good writer and journalist Hadley is. Funny and pointed.," I, for example, could not give a single fig about sport, and yet I do not spend my time leaving comments beneath articles about the European Championships such as: “What is the point of this????? Boring!!!!! Look at all these overpaid idiots!!!!” as some folk are wont to do beneath articles about fashion. When I hear people talk about how excited they are about, I don’t know, Arsenal, I don’t run up to them bellowing: “But why?!

Boring!!!!! Look at all these overpaid idiots!!!!” as some folk are wont to do beneath articles about fashion. You can find lots of comments exactly like that under articles on football, and also many other topics. Read the TV pages, they are full of commments from people boasting about not even having a TV. An Apple launch is usually followed by pages of vitriol. The problem with fashion as compared to, say, Apple launches is not that it's frivolous and female, but that it's arbitrary and childish. A new Apple product will usually be better than last year's model. This year's clothes will simply be different from last year's and something that would have got you laughed at will now be deemed eminently desiarable--as long as Alexa or Cara has been seen wearing it. The only possible defence for fashion is that it is nothing to do with making clothes for women at all but is actually a form of high art practised by people like Jean Paul Gaultier and Vivienne Westwood."," The reason people feel free to dismiss fashion with a “what’s the point”...is because fashion is aimed at women No it isn't. I've never once dismissed it simply because it's aimed at women, and I'll bet that thousands of others haven't either. The sexism knee-jerk strikes again.", Fair enough. Along the bottom of this article are titles like: How to navigate the new era of coat wearing. Are ripped designer jeans the new Ugg boot? What style of bathing suit should I wear to impress the chic French? Can you defend these?," I don't think you're entirely fair to dismiss Marcus like that, Hadley. The reason many of us look at fashion shows and ask ' what's the point? ' - is because so much of what we see on the catwalk is unwearable. Half of it doesn't even look like clothes. We get the idea of fashion shows. A designer shows off his collection, the press take pictures, reviewers say ooh or hmm, and on it goes. But when the ' collection ' is made out of binliners, or features a hat like a satellite dish - I think ' what is the point? ' is an entirely fair question."," What is the point of fashion? 1. Its sellers make a lot of money 2. It provides a means for people lacking minds of their own to make choices. Its net effect is waste through planned obsolescence. It so called value to the economy is a measure of its waste, not of its contribution."," I find fashion unbearably boring, but at least I can pretty much avoid it - unlike bloody football!"," To give the recreational drug industry a post-summer boost, one would assume.", Its a massive industry... it makes a lot of money..

Either they don't really read this column, or they must have terrible memory..."," It's a good attempt, and I can see why the Guardian wanted it written. But it's still five paragraphs of whimsical flannel. To answer the two questions succinctly: 1. The point of London Fashion Week is to get the Mayor's Office (i.e. the London taxpayer), the Department for International Trade (the British taxpayer) and the European Union (ditto) to subsidise the marketing efforts of the 'luxury goods' industry, and to provide an opportunity to extort coverage from publications that rely on its advertising. 2. There's a lot of coverage because The Guardian, among others, can't afford to lose the advertising contracts that, explicitly or otherwise, demand that coverage."," If it is not a violation of privacy, can we see a picture of your dog with hair like Andrew Ridgeley, please? (I assume from when he was in Wham!, not nowadays, as to my surprise I have just discovered that he is now almost completely bald and what is left is white. Or perhaps you have styled your dog's hair like this? Don't tell the RSPCA.)"," White Palace Spader, obviously."," I don't think the questioner was trying to be rude? A lot of us are baffled at the snippets we see on these events-- wafer-thin models, wearing wild makeup and clothes that nobody else ever seems to, aside from maybe an Oscar red carpet walk. The whole thing appears absurd to many guys, and we wonder what the point of it is. That's all. The football analogy fails because even if you don't like sport, you know the point of it is to entertain fans (and make money). These runway shows appear to show off clothes no one ever buys, in sizes no one wears, thus the original poster's question."," The fashion industry in the UK is also worth 666 billion pounds and employs 555,000 people in this country. Therefore everything which furthers it's success is a good thing."," ... but Apple launches *are* dismissed in that way, by many, many loud voices. :-)"," Surely the point of Fashion Week is so that people are encouraged to throw their old clothes away, buy a whole set of new ones, just to keep the Thai and Bangladeshi sweatshops going.", This is what’s called “running a business” Nice womansplaining!," I don't think Hadley's been concentrating very hard if she's never seen or heard of sport being dismissed in this way. You won't have to look very hard to find comments under olympic articles dismissing it all as running in circles or throwing a stick. It's the same when the World Cup is on '22 overpaid primadonnas chasing a bag of air about', etc etc etc until the end of time."," I am female, and Fashion week is an utter bore to me. I would prefer to watch tennis, Formula 1 or rugby, so no, fashion is not exclusively a 'female' pastime. To watch skinny, underfed girls prancing down a catwalk wearing the most ridiculous clothes that no one would look at twice, if they were not made by a famous fashion designer, and cost a fortune, is not my idea of fun or interest to me. The way some women follow fashion just makes me laugh....last year red was in, but this year if you want to look good don't wear red, it's passé dahling! Why some fall for the hype is beyond me. Each to their own, but don't pretend that other than making huge amounts of money for those designers and their fashion houses, that those ridiculous, frivolous strips of cloth, which wouldn't fit the vast majority of women, are anything but an extravagance for the rich and famous to show off their wealth."," My brother says the same about the Premiership.

End of discussion..."," Any woman can look at the runways and get inspiration, such as how good your striped jumper would look with your metallic long skirt from Zara (thanks, Gucci, for that one) It's not just for women, though.

I may speak for myself and my friends of the time."," I personally find it curious that a feminist should support a women fashion show or a beauty contest. Both objectify women and turn certain physical characteristics into commodity. And then some moneyed &quot;intellectuals&quot; come along and think, well, I cannot look as &quot;gorgeous&quot; as these models, but I can at least buy into the elite and wear the same shit, and still be better than the lowly plebs."," Thank you, Hadley! Plus, it's a relief from (not a replacement for) the truly horrible news. I think of it as a kind of people's art: to view, copy, laugh at, admire. You didn't mention how fashion reporting can also bring about a push for better work conditions for the people who make the clothes and accessories, not to mention model them. The industry is as prone as any other capitalist endeavor to exploitation for profits.

My ideal broadsheet (to which the Guardian is still closest) would take the insults and argument elsewhere and come back to me with something that is as informative, enlightening, clear and persuasive as this AND pleasant to read."," To answer your most important question, Hadley: White Palace James Spader every time! (Though 1994 Stargate James Spader beats both I feel)."," The same question is regularly aimed at Apple launches and sport - in this very publication.

Or am I just getting old?.," Why aren't sport, film, or Apple launches dismissed in the same way as fashion? Seriously. Fashion doesn't need defending, nor does film, but people obsessed with sports and technologies have pathological identity issues that need to be addressed. These competitive addictions need treatment, not indulgence and encouragement. Men are raised from infancy to believe their acceptance and cultural worth are totally dependent on their identification with &quot;The Team&quot; and &quot;The Game,&quot; in at least as insidious and dependent a manner as women are conditioned to strive to be &quot;Pretty,&quot; and women for the most part are attracted to couch jocks."," Fashion shows aren’t just telling women to buy specific clothes – they show women how to wear clothes in more modern, often fun, ways. That must be why I'm wearing my clothes in an old fashioned miserable way then, cos I never go to fashion shows."," Are we allowed to mention the exploitation of children both as models and those who work in the sweatshops making these items? I think this is the biggest criticism that can be levelled at the fashion industry. At least football does have child protection rules and guidance, designed with the child in mind."," Poor Hadley, destined to answer vacuous questions for ever it seems.", `Fashion` nowadays is using little pieces of fabric ( that is for size 8 ) with a `label` sewn into it for the designers ego .

Because fashion is aimed at women This isn't actually true is it, lots of people moan about football or the Olympics, most people can see the point of yet another superhero movie and only people who are both mad and vacuous care about Apple launches."," Much of this makes sense, whether or not one approves. But the idolising and parading of the abnormally thin, along with the industry's full knowledge of fashion's appeal to impressionable young women, does put it into the realm of the morally questionable. Every now and then, something happens that raises fresh appeals for change, but there's never any real intention to acknowledge and change. At least football fans in their XXXL club shirts are very clearly not influenced by the physiques of their idols. Not sure whether to cheer at that or groan."," Disliking fashion is not about disliking women. Quite the opposite It's about objecting to its adherents who collaborate with the purveyors of over-priced, impractical clothes on forcibly anorexic pre-pubescents. &quot;Fashion&quot; is not about design and style it is about hawking an idea of elitism so that, for instance, people walk around with a bag on which is written &quot;It is not a bag&quot; and think that they are being somehow clever. Good design would provide clothes that unite form and function and that are suitable to actually wear. In the street. Every day. By actual women. Not a size 0. Well cut clothes from practical fabrics.

The point of Fashion Week is to Sell, sell, sell!"," Respectfully Hadley your analysis is woeful, bordering on I couldn't be bothered. Confessions of a New York fashion worker. Fashion shows and much of the industry exist: 1. To give marginally talented celebrities something to do between making unbearable artistic contributions to their fields. 2. To give same said celebrities as much free stuff as possible so as to allow them to use their disproportionate earnings for other excesses of consumption and exhibition. 3. To showcase the pathology of desire under the guise of creativity and expression. 4. To entice huge sums out of hard earned cash from parents bank accounts to fund expensive 'educations' in the craft of fashion which has been long forgotten and ignored. 5. To support media empires with free content and product for their idol magazines and portals with the hope that they will be hailed as worthy. The real reason is.... 6. (On said media). To extract as much of the borrowed or inherited blood currency used to develop collections by picking the design 'winners' most likely to be future advertisers and not for their actual talent. (Thanks Anna). 7. To hasten the demise of the planet by flying all the same people to New York, London, Milan and Paris many times a year and driving them around in Escolades (big big cars). 8. To give the beautiful young offspring of rich men and former models something to do in becoming models themselves. 9. To give the neomaniacal youth another distraction while (social) media corporations suck their will, esteem and polyester pockets. I could bore you some more but won't 10. Finally to justify, optimise and externalise the maximal exploitation of natural resources and foreign labour in far away countries.

Can't quite work out of you're being disingenuous with a strawman to accuse the op of being sexist or if you're just generally ignorant of things outside your interest. I suspect the former since I find it hard to believe it's possible to have missed people going 'what's the point?' to all of your examples plus plenty of others, usually the more niche the activity or interest the more people will question its validity. Eg something such as train spotting (which is largely male dominated for whatever reason) is frequently mocked. But even football gets questioned by those who think it largely consists of 22 very overpaid people running about who literally dive into golden raspberry winning levels of acting should they get hit by an errant gust of wind. You're also generalising the questioners point from a very specific event out to fashion in general. That would be similar to going from 'what's the point of car shows/clubs/whatever' which many people might ask, to 'what's the point of cars?' which far fewer will wonder. He may well be fine with fashion but not quite see the link in London fashion week where pretty much all pictures in the media show clothes that even the avant garde would be unlikely to be seen in public wearing, let alone anyone else.

Also, you're implying that theatre, film, and technology aren't aimed at or applicable to women. How sexist."," Fashion parades have changed purpose over the years haven't they. It used to be that designers made clothes which were intended for upper-middle class normally thin women. These clothes would actually be wearable, in the right circles and events. They would then be more or less adapted for the more ordinary women to wear, mass produced with more ordinary materials. Models were well known, but not super stars, just models. The press were invited to publicise the clothes, magazines would be sold. All very normal business really. Nowadays, it's like stepping into another dimension, with clothes being designed as stylistic experiments, not as wearable garments.

And of course, to the extent that bodily narcissism is monopolized by women (which it largely is), targeting fashion for ridicule will produce apparent overlap with the female population. The other pursuits mentioned by Hadley are in fact pursuits and they require skills, and dedication to the acquisition of skills that have little to do with employing one's genetically gifted anatomy simply to pose for attention. For a anyone who forcefully advocates being valued for ability, character, achievement (both mental and physical) rather than anatomy, the amount of interest shown by women in fashion has to be a disappointment, doesn't it? I mean, if one sees oneself primarily as a display object isn't it a difficult ask at the least and downright hypocritical or disingenuous at worst, to have others not do so also, etc? I don't think one can have it all ways. I don't think that many regard narcissism as an adequate substitute for action. substance or achievement, etc."," My reason for not buying ANY apple product, is because Apple are busily designing a newer &quot;better&quot; version of the very latest device even before the latest devise is available.

Gap has just launched its “dad shorts” – wide-legged denims – precisely the sort of thing your dad wears on holiday. “Fussy cuts are known to increase sales,” explains APC’s Jean Toutoiu after explaining why he launched his hybrid of stretch with raw denim which helped the label’s sales increase by 40% and which explains the rise and rise of the boyfriend jean (M&S, Topshop and Asos all have their own “boyfriend” jean section). Take Barack Obama, a defiant wearer of “dad” jeans: “The truth” he replied after much ridicule, “is I generally look very sharp in jeans.” Sure you do. So, with Easter in mind – a time of family and togetherness – here are five jean styles from the family tree.

Dad shorts

What are they? Not the official name, granted, but a fitting one nonetheless. These wide-legged pseudo-cut-off shorts are a marker that the unisex trend is branching out into something more cross-generational. Loose enough to be unisex and low-rise to the point of belt-dependent, if these don’t remind you of something your dad wore on holiday in Cromer while holding a mug of soup then, well, nothing will.

We like “Dad” shorts, Gap.co.uk for pricing.

Boyfriend jeans

What are they? Off-duty denim, essentially, with a #humblebrag name designed to incite disgust and rage, these are designed to look like men’s jeans – loose fit, wider ankle, low-rise – instead that they fit your ass a little snugger. Despite all this, these remain limpet-tight fixtures in the denim arena and one of the biggest shapes. From Whistles to M&S to River Island and Topshop, who have been tub-thumping their own version for several years (arguably mainstreaming the whole look) and now sell them in around 16 shades.

Mom jeans

What are they? High-waisted and unequivocally unflattering, it’s thought the term “mom jeans” began life as a pejorative term in a Saturday Night Live sketch before becoming an actual trend courtesy of Topshop and Calvin Klein. Remarkable, really, given the shape, but there you go. This style is provoking a mixed response. Matches fashion are very pro: “we are seeing a good response to the ‘Mom’ jean” with Bliss and Mischief and Aries their key brands. Alyson Walsh, author of Style Forever: the grown-up guide to looking fabulous, takes more convincing: “Now that midlife has been reinvented, we are dressing to please ourselves and certainly not like our mums/moms. Also it’s fine to do this when you are young and being postmodern or ironic but not when you’re over 50.”

We like BDG mom jeans, £55, Urban Outfitters.

Girlfriend jeans

What are they? Essentially piggybacking the whole trend in family-jeans, these are a slightly more feminine version of the boyfriend jean. With a higher rise, and slightly tighter fit, the vibe is more taller older sister. Heels, to our mind, are essential (otherwise you might end up with a pair of these).

We like Girlfriend jeans, £44.95, Gap.

Nephew jeans

What are they? Again, one of our own noms de plume, this time for boyfriend jeans that are so comically baggy, so teenage, they probably come with a packet of Rizla in the pocket – but are excellent nonetheless. Pair with white pumps or Swedish Hasbeens lest you be mistaken for a 14-year-old.

It's really aimed at younger people...and whatever the fashion is...it always looks super good on them...errr... because they are the arbiters of what looks good ! Older people will generally wear what is comfortable...and they are usually less concerned how good it looks...and they have very little influence on what looks good... because they are not young ! There! Think I've got it!, One hundred and eighty five pounds ...?," I wish you'd do an article about jeans for 45 year-old women who still have a relatively good figure because of good genes, a healthy diet and lots of exercise, but have had two children so inevitably have extra weight around the stomach and hips. In other words, which jeans will I look good in, seeing as I wear the darn things pretty much every day and don't look like the gorgeous young models in this article (and, incidentally, never have, even in my glorious 20s)?", The jeans fashion advice I need is: should I wear my jeans with my paunch hanging over the belt or with the belt over my paunch?, £185 for jeans that fit like crap?

I have a stack of about 15-20 jeans that represented different periods in fashion and my life. Anyway, my 15-year-old son has just discovered them and has decided some of them are very cool. (I'm his mother, btw.) To my eyes it looks quite funny to see him going off in a well-washed pair of jeans that I used to wear all the time but...if the denim fits...anyone can wear it."," Holy smoke! I didn't know there was so much noise attached to jeans. Where do Levi 501's or 507's stand in the marking. When i've worn the first patch on the knee I cut them to make shorts which then usually wear on the bum, being for summer leisure time. Then they get cut-up for cleaning and polishing cloths. That's the 10 life year cycle of my pair of jeans."," Went to buy some man jeans yesterday, many skinnys' available, row upon row.

The same as an 80's kid's mum managed with a pair of kitchen scissors. Is this what fashion students come up with? (I've always worn baggy shorts, I hate most women's shorts. They're always too revealing, too tight, too uncomfortable and have crappy pockets.)"," What the hell is Obama doing in some fat secret service man's jeans, he's the President FFS....", When it comes to short jeans I tend to favour the Fire Island Houseboy look. It certainly gets me attention when I'm pushing my trolley through Sainsburys.," And here was me thinking dad jeans had a seam ironed down the front. Baggy black cutoffs, cut below the knee, few rips in the thighs, midlife crisis? Moi? Now, where's my skate shoes and iron maiden tee-shirt?", Why is it the only shorts you can get these days are knee length or longer. Is it because so many expensive long boxers are being sold?, It's almost impossible to get decent shorts these days. And by shorts I mean shorts that are relatively short rather than those things that barely show a bit of knee. Why has it become unacceptable for a gent to show a bit of leg?," What the hell are 'Mom jeans?' Is that supposed to be 'Mum jeans'? My mum's jeans were made of demim coloured crimpline and looked fucking awful. I'm a mum, I wear my kid's jeans."," Most jeans are made in Asia, the biggest share in Bangladesh, and they cost about $1 -$2 to make. So I don't throw my hard earned cash at those in the stratospheric price range, just buy lots of pairs at about $10 each and use my hard earned cash (did I say that already?) for a decent bottle of wine and tickets to concerts, both good for the body and the mind.", Dad shorts: find your oldest pair of jeans with an intact crotch (so that your nuts don't hang out) and cut off legs at the knee.

Those of us in the US when Diet Coke first launched remember its ""world premiere"" television ad, with Linda Evans, Telly Savalas and Bob Hope toasting its success. Well, it was a big deal, the first new brand to be launched by Coca-Cola since 1886. The ad that most people are more likely to remember, though, is the Diet Coke Break: the one launched in 1994 where the builder gets his kit off for the girls for elevenses, to that ballsy Etta James soundtrack. It was clever, funny and perfectly gave the finger to Kleenex and Nestlé with their stupid campaigns for man-sized tissues and chunky Yorkie Bars.

That was Diet Coke's turning point – targeting the drink towards women, even though 40% of its drinkers were supposedly male. But then hasn't that always been the key to moving a product, getting to the people who are actually doing the bloody shopping? Which might go some way to explaining why Diet Coke is not only the second most popular soft drink in the world but has also become synonymous with the fashion industry.

In the 1990s, Diet Coke became the can clutched in every model and celebrity's manicured hand. And, via the explosion of paparazzi culture and celebrity magazines, that relationship was seen in every home. The supermodel diet of Marlboro Lights and Diet Coke may not have topped the bestsellers chart alongside the Atkins, but it was there in photographs in every magazine. Diet Coke became the ultimate accessible fashion accessory. Cheaper than an It-bag, more obvious than a perfume, and available in every corner shop.

Sociologist Ashley Mears infiltrated the fashion world and worked as a model while researching her doctorate and publishing her research in the 2011 book Pricing Fashion: The Making of a Fashion Model. She recalls those glistening silver cans well. ""I remember seeing Diet Coke backstage at most of the shows,"" she says. ""Getting products into models' hands was thought to be a great source of low-cost advertising. Anthropologists have long argued that there are no free gifts – perks and freebies are given away to specific groups of people who have the capital to reciprocate. My sense is that Diet Coke embeds itself deliberately at fashion events for this specific reason.""

Where once Diet Coke's ""ambassador"" was Bob Hope, now it's Jean Paul Gaultier, who last year replaced Karl Lagerfeld as the brand's creative director. eBay bristles with the limited-edition Diet Coke bottles designed by the likes of Matthew Williamson, Moschino, Etro and Roberto Cavalli. According to Marketing Week, there's a three-year strategy to embed the product into the industry further. Zoe Howorth, the market-activation director for Coca-Cola GB, has said that the target is to get Diet Coke seen as a brand ""for demanding fashionistas"".

Hence the barrels of it on ice at London fashion week, being served by cute guys in muscle T-shirts. Hence the Diet Coke website that was formed in partnership with Yahoo, InStyle and Marie Claire, entitled Style it Light. Although, I notice, it currently only has 1,739 Twitter followers.

And there's the rub. Coke may be classic, but fashion folk, they're fickle. As one designer friend, who used not to be able to get through a meeting without a can, says: ""Diet Coke is not the fashion drink any more – it's the rehab drink.""

Model Poppy Delevingne, who has worked for Burberry and Louis Vuitton, tells me that ""Diet or no diet, I don't do Coca-Cola. Without sounding crass, it makes me burp like a trumpet – spoiling instantly the model-as- perfection persona. Pass me the coconut water any day…""

Delevingne thinks it was probably ""those Diet Coke ads with the topless totty and spindly secretaries"" that made the drink so appealing. The brand may have moved on – but the new ""cropped logo"" can, launched in August last year, proved it's still cool as hell. It will serve them well for the next 30 years.

Coke highs: three of the drink's best fashion moments



Karl Lagerfeld's bottle design, 2012 Karl Lagerfeld launches his Diet Coke bottle design with a troupe of male models dressed up like, um, Karl Lagerfeld. He declares: ""I drink Diet Coke from the minute I get up to the minute I go to bed. I don't drink coffee, I don't drink tea; I drink nothing else.""

Derek Zoolander's Diet Coke advert, 2001 Ben Stiller ""Blue Steeled"" his way through this fake ad in Zoolander, spraying the brown, syrupy drink all over himself like an overexcited seal. Derek Zoolander may be a byword for fit-but-dim male models – but we doubt it hurt the brand one bit.

Lady Gaga's 'Telephone' music video, 2010 One of the smartest pieces of product placement ever. Diet Coke cans as hair rollers were the real stars of the ""Telephone"" music video – and they really do give a good curl. We've tried.",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/jan/12/diet-coke-fashion-favourite-fizz#comments," This article has the stink of PR-coursed advertorial about it. Even if it is independently sourced, it reads like a press release. I know Guardian Online is staffed by a load of Gen-Y hipsters and all, but more and more of this popcorn journalism is appearing here these days and it's seriously beginning to look cheap. It takes credibility away from the good writers producing good journalism and undermines the whole product. Anyone else agree?", Was this article written by a 10 year old who won a competition or something? Bless.," Diet Coke is not cool. I tell everyone I know that it's deeply unfashionable. People believe me and actively disassociate themselves from the cloying drink. For a start, its can is a rehash of one of Liverpool FC's worst away kits from the late eighties. Kieth Chegwin likes it so much he's got a swimming pool filled with it. When Jimmy Saville used to cry he'd cry tears of Diet Coke. Tell everyone it's really daggy, one day we'll bring down the ugly Diet Coke behemoth. Boo to Diet Coke!!!!"," If you think diet coke is cloyingly sweet, try the full sugar variety. I prefer diet coke because it is less sweet, and in fact if it is really cold it's quite sharp in flavour compared to a lot of soft drinks."," What the?! Guardian, are you drunk? Delete this article immediately.", It's not the fashion industry's favourite kind of coke though........., Just don't think about the aspartame..., This piece has been brought to you by The Coca Cola Company... putting Type 2 Diabetes at everyone's reach.," A huge conglomerate pay lots of people who make clothing a lot of money. Please stop. It's just a drink, nice enough but we don't need to have to be force fed this shite."," If I read this right, people with taste have to be paid to be associated with Diet Coke. Or have I missed something?"," I must be very easily influenced, because I really want some Pepsi Max now.", This company = avoid at all costs., A drink that actively advertises the fact that is has absolutely zero nutritional value - hate the stuff.," And frankly I'm getting fed up with Diet Coke being portrayed as essentially a brand for women, gay men and 'fashionistas'. I'm a straight bloke. I also have Type 1 diabetes. So I drink diet soft drinks, not because I think it's some fashionable trend, not because I'm a wanker, not because I'm buying into a lifestyle, not because I'm dieting or watching my figure. I drink Diet Coke because I want a soft drink I can drink that won't wreak havoc with my blood sugar level. I don't want some poncy can that's supposed to make a statement about my lifestyle, particularly if it's a statement that isn't even true. Thanks Coca-Cola - you had someone who was reasonably happy to buy your drinks but unless you put half as much effort into making Coke Zero more available as you do in 'fashionista-ing' Diet Coke, you're going to lose buyers. I don't even get why the old Diet Coke advert was more about getting women to drink Diet Coke. Who was the person actually drinking the Diet Coke, eh? The slightly desperate secretaries, or the sculpted bloke with his shirt off?"," Having the likes of Karl 'Deathmask' Lagerfeld singing the praises of your product hardly makes it 'stylish', please. Give me a glass of water anytime above that muck."," Coke = bad for you, tastes alright, wakes you up a bit Diet coke = bad for you, tastes like crap, fails to wake you up Marketing guff = bad for you, tastes utterly foul, sends you to sleep", I heard Diet Coke causes erectile dysfunction.," Wait a minute, hold on! From the article I get the impression that this artificially sweetened and flavoured water, made by a faceless corporation with a dubious human rights record, is some sort of victory for feminists. Did anyone else get that impression?"," I have absolutely no idea what phenomenon this article is talking about. I don't think I have ever known anyone who thinks the Diet version of Coca-Cola is a cool product. Cars, fashion, certain made-on-the-spot alcoholic drinks that have appeared in television shows......yes........but not a fizzy drink brought to your table in a normal glass, available in any old greasy spoon."," Is really a serious piece , Really ? Its not a joke ? .Cos trust us it looks like one ............."," 1. It tastes disgusting. I don't give a toss if aspartame is toxic, but it tastes naaaasty. 2. Have you ever seen a thin person drinking Diet Coke? Thought not. (It doesn't count if they were being paid to drink it.) Only fat people seem to drink these disgusting diet drinks. I suspect they don't have a very good sense of taste and that may be something to do with why they are fat in the first place. Supertasters are usually pretty thin.", Sorry but what is this shit?," Artificial sweeteners taste sweeter than sugar, so less is needed to flavor a food. Therefore, foods are usually lower in calorie if they contain these natural or chemical compounds. Artificial sweeteners do not directly influence the blood sugar levels because they don't contain carbohydrates, fats or protein. However, foods with these sweeteners usually contain other ingredients that can increase blood sugar levels. Therefore, Diet Coke at 30 = Hello Diabetes Type 2.", Diet coke tastes a bit bland.

It has no sweet tang, no sharpness. Miserably bland. Diet Pepsi, Sainsburys' and Asda own brands are a milion times tastier, and a lot cheaper too."," There's something deeply addictive about it. I have two relatives (one sensible, one not) who buy it into the house in those big bottles, and are constantly throwing it down their necks. Now - just for balance - I'm practically an alcoholic, and a night never goes by without a shitload of booze: but we all understand the chemistry there. What the fuck is in diet coke that makes people act similarly?", Unbelievable. Why don't we have an article on how great rat poison is?," I'm always curious about the military-industrial complex's evil conspiracy to poison consumers with aspartame. Surely killing your customers isn't good business sense? How are they going to buy more Diet Coke if they're dead? Drink too much of the stuff myself probably, but I'm more concerned about all the phosphate in it--bad for your teeth."," How did it happen? Firstly, Aspartame - an accidentally discovered chemical in the search for nerve gases and other chemical warfare - was somehow very sweet. Initially rejected by the FDA, then the decision turned around by the intervention of the team of the newly elected president, George Bush the First, (as a favour to his friend, Donald Rumsfeld, who would later become famous for supplying the chemical gases that Sadam Hussein used on the Kurds and finally was executed for.) All that was missing at this point was a multi-million dollar advertising campaign and the world's most carcinogenic, Alzheimer inducing, obesity making drink was born. Blinded by the glamour of fitness and success portrayed in the ads, &quot;everyone&quot; swallowed it happily, despite it tasting absolutely horrible. Or, as it were, it tastes of what it is: a toxic chemical unfit for human consumption. It is in terms of health and profit a true killer and mindlessly perpetuating its status in an article like this borders on criminal behaviour.", Its great after sex., I do drink tons of the stuff but I all but quite drinking for a period last year and it just filled the void and full fat soft drinks where making me put on weight.," I thought it was empty beer cans in Gaga's hair. All we saw was the metal ends of the cans with the ring-pulls. If Coke paid Gaga a fortune for product placement, they clearly wasted their money."," Surely people have moved on. Fizzy drinks = bad skin, which isn't a great fit with looking good a la the fashion world. Maybe it's the time lag allied to the marketing &amp; lack of awareness that still drives consumption.", It's great for cleaning permanent markers off white boards.," Caffiene gives me headaches and I don't like the aftertaste of artificial sweetners, apart form that I think it's ok. Just thought I'd try and add some balance to this PR.", What a lot of bollocks!, LOVE my Diet Coke - although Guarana is a close second," Diet Coke is probably the most disgustingly synthetic tasting drink out there, I find it hard to believe its so popular, Coke Zero on the other hand is magnificent.", It has 1.3 calories.

Anyway, a thoroughly unhealthy drink that tries to sell itself as a healthy alternative - that is a turn-off for a start."," Last week the New Zealand Herald published a story which said: &quot;A study has linked soft drinks to depression - with diet versions particularly problematic.&quot; &quot;Those who drank more than four cans of soft drinks a day were 30 per cent more likely to have had depression than those who drank none, the American Academy of Neurology conference heard. The risk seemed greater among those who preferred diet drinks.&quot;"," 'It was clever, funny and perfectly gave the finger to Kleenex and Nestlé with their stupid campaigns for man-sized tissues and chunky Yorkie Bars .'

Regarding: - Diet coke being advertised in these pages - It being fashionable I hate to say this, but I have not heard the Guardian being cited as a major influencer in fashion - I would suggest that this piece is of little consequence and that its impact will be minimal. It does, however, make us all participate indignantly in the comments piece."," Anyone who still drinks ANY soda, never mind diet soda, is asking for trouble... and deserves it. First... ALL soda is horrendously overpriced, based on the cost of ingredients, and possibly the single product in the world that produces the most waste and garbage. Second, artificial sweeteners are carcinogens. Look it up. Non-diet soda is made with high-fructose corn syrup, far worse for you than sugar."," Diet sodas are corrupting to morals and the palate equally, as well as extremely injurious to the health. The fact that people think that the heavily glutamic flavour is acceptable shows just how far their decline has gone. Normal UK Coca-Cola in its smaller formats is a very decent and refreshing occasional treat."," Well, it was a big deal, the first new brand to be launched by Coca-Cola since 1886. Looks like you (or your subeditor) misread the Wikipedia article on Diet Coke . It was the first new brand using the Coca-Cola trademark since 1886; a number of other brands, including Fanta, Sprite and TaB (an earlier artificially sweetened cola drink) were launched decades prior to Diet Coke."," Happy 30th Birthday, Diet Coke. It hardly seems possible you're so young. How can the Personal Computer be older than you? What a bizarre thing to say. How can the Sinclair C5 be younger than Diet Coke? Where once Diet Coke's &quot;ambassador&quot; was Bob Hope, now it's Jean Paul Gaultier, who last year replaced Karl Lagerfeld as the brand's creative director If I was the ambassador/creative director of Diet Coke, I'd drop the &quot;Diet&quot; from the name and rename regular Coke &quot;Fat Coke&quot;."," Karl Lagerfeld.

Oh, please, just grow up!","So, those knitted hats that look like animal heads with long dangling mittens attached that are made to look like paws, worn by adult women. Um, what?

Charlotte, by email

""Um, what"" indeed, Charlotte, ""um, what"" indeed. In fact, let's just leave it at that: Um, what. For that, really, is all that needs saying about this improbably and unacceptably popular cold-weather wear for the ladies: um, what. Let's all break for recess!

Oh sorry, it turns out there are no breaks in this class and rather we must all give this issue the time and attention one would bestow upon a double physics lesson, but with added outrage.

Because this look – this, above all others – stirs outrage in me. Yes, outrage. OK, it might not be as grievous an infraction as, I don't know, third-degree murder, but I'd say it's up there with assault – an assault on my eyes and on the reputation of the human species. Worn on anyone born after 2003 – fine. Worn on anyone born before – deserving of imprisonment.

As if all this weren't painful enough, I wrote about the unforgivable wrongness of these hats last year. Yet, amazingly, it seems the world has not heeded my advice, for they are, if anything, more popular in Britain now and are downright ubiquitous in the US, which means they will only continue to sprout like rabid fungi in the UK next year. Truly, my work is never done. It is my lot to be doomed to be the Sisyphus of style.

Look, fashion is supposed to be fun. It is supposed to be joyful. It is supposed to be about allowing people to express a certain side of themselves, to experiment with different looks, to enjoy their creativity. Women can revel in their femininity or dabble in tomboyish things. Sexy, butch, pretty, directional: knock yourselves out, ladies.

However, there is one look that I'm afraid makes me come over a little bit fascist because I simply cannot countenance it: childish. Not cute – cute's OK; not my favourite look for a grown woman but I can live with it – but CHILDISH. In short, it is not acceptable, ladies, to dress like a child if you are not a child, and it never ceases to amaze me how often this rule is forgotten, and by how many.

To paraphrase the Bible (forgive me and my heathenish ways), when you are a child, you speak as a child and you dress as a child. But when you become a grownup, you put away childish things and among those things are the following: hair bunches; hair bands or slides that are clearly made for five-year-olds; mittens in any pastel colour; tops with writing on them in general but especially writing that refers to the wearer as ""girl""; shoes with animal faces on them; and most of all, any item of clothing designed to make the wearer resemble an animal.

There is no question that there is plenty of pressure out there on women to maintain their youth and never look a day past 25. At times, this pressure becomes so exaggerated and so ubiquitous that its message is that women should basically look like children. This is what lies behind the ridiculous standards of thinness expected of women in the public eye, rendering them closer in appearance to 12-year-olds than 32-year-olds. To make a woman look like a child is to make her unthreatening, helpless and worthy of condescension. When women dress like children, they encourage this attitude.

Animal hat-wearing ladies, stop it. Stop it now, I say. Do not apologise for being grown women. It is great to be a woman! Sure, it was nice being a girl, but that time has been and gone and it is most definitely ungreat to pretend you are a girl when you are a woman. Stop fearing adulthood by dressing like a child and stop thinking that you should make yourselves all ickle wickle with no opinions of any value because you're just a little girly-girl in your animal hat with attached paws.

You are strong, smart, intelligent women and you should not apologise for that or think you should be smaller/younger/stupider/thinner/more animal-like than you are. So just buy a normal hat, buy some normal gloves and most of all – and I say this with nothing but love in my heart and sympathy in my voice – grow up.",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/feb/04/cute-animal-hat-grow-up#comments," There's a very elderly chap around my way who wears a lion hat on cold mornings. Fair play to him, I say."," An interesting article, Hadley. You make some very good points about this self-inflicted infantilisation and I suppose it does have some disturbing connotations. But against that, I have a strong suspicion you would look just adorable in a little panda hat with furry ears. It's a tricky situation."," Very sorry that you've decided to stop having fun, Hadley. Still, filling out your tax returns and searching for a better deal on your mortgage must be a riot of a Saturday night."," The woman in the picture looks fine. Why do you care so much what brings other people happiness? I know it's supposed to be an acerbic column, but lumping all women who like cute hats into age apologists and ditzes is not doing a whole hell of a lot for women in general."," for goodness sake, let people wear animal hats if they want without critism, its far better than wearing the animals themselves"," Hadley, I almost always agree with your commentaries, but this article puzzles me. I personally think animal hats are hideous and would never wear them myself, but I'm not offended by women who do. You argument that women should 'grow up' is slightly offensive. Your assumption is that women are wearing these godawful hats to make them appear more childlike, but this is just an assumption. Perhaps women are expressing their 'creative side' or experimenting with fashion, which you support. Who knows? The fact of the matter is, as ridiculous as it looks, it's their choice. Also, more importantly, I think keeping the child inside us is very important. Not to say that we should forget our responsibilities as adults, but keeping the inner child alive is important, and if people want to do that through wearing ugly clothes, that's their choice."," Damn, I'm a 35 year old guy and I've bought myself one of these things. I'm assuming, article writer, that you should probably want me publicly flogged. It's a warm hat, and a bit of fun. Chill out."," I guess your advice about growing up will also apply to women who write a diary, like horses a lot, collect stuffed animals or barbie dolls, prefer to go out and have an ice cream with their friends instead of going on a date, and many other things that little girls do, and are obviously just signs of immaturity? If anything, I'd say the opposite is more unsettling, young girls dressing as women seems like it would be more worthy of your ire.."," You really should have stopped at &quot;umm what&quot;, would have been a much better article, instead, churlish rant."," Similar type of annoyance - women pretending to be a bit thick, when they aren't. Stop dumbing yourself down, ladies! We have enough people doing that for us."," Just seen an adult, male, Glaswegian bus driver step out of his cab wearing one of these hats, to the delight of his Polish colleagues."," As far as I am concerned &quot;growing up&quot; also means discovering the ability to be tolerant of others in all regards, whether it's their race, sexuality or choice of hat. Perhaps the wearers are not the only people who have some growing up to do."," I hadn't seen this style of hat as infantalising, more as a sort of joke, there was a time when people wore real fox fur, with the head still on, my assumption was that the joke was associated with that, rather than trying to copy children's cothing. though usually we hate in others what we hate in ourselves."," I like to think that these women are independently wealthy, and that they are either truly blissful alone or are in happy, fulfilling relationships. That way, these women do not have to worry about running into a co-worker or scaring off a date with animal headgear. Let's also talk about the real outrage here: How many Muppets have been gruesomely murdered, just so these women can wear a real Muppet scalp on their heads? Too many, my friends, too many.", Grown women wearing animal hats really turn me on. There. I said it.," Hadley, for pity's sake lighten up - what's wrong with you today? And what's wrong with a little whimsy on a crappy, cold day? Not a good look for me, I'll grant you, but Laura Prepon looks extremely cute.", I will never relinquish my rabbit hat. But then it doesn't have the pointless traily down side flappy bits. Just ears and a tail oh and I also love wearing my dunagrees- they're comfy and you can fit a banana/tv remote/screwdriver in one of the long pockets. Deal with that.," I do agree with a lot of your points especially about infantalisation and dumbing down but, as the proud owner of a large spotty, furry coat with ears I have to say its nothing to do with putting myself in any other position than I really love the way it looks and the warmth it provides! I just think that the best marker of confidence (something which you gain as you get older) is being able to say, SO WHAT? If you love it don't let anyone say otherwise!"," For the love of Odin!! Who gives a monkeys what someone chooses to wear on their heads. Wear a pair of trousers for all I care, or a potted plant. I certainly try not to judge people for what they wear. This strikes me as another form of 'conform or be bullied'. Fashion bullying. Thor's knickers, I'd have hoped you left those sorts of attitudes in the schoolyard."," You want to complain about people wearing animal hats? Oh, please, just feck off and find something more important to write about. I think it's quite empowering to have the confidence to wear something silly and fun in public. Makes people smile. Don't think that's setting feminism back, is it?"," Gosh, this annoys me too. My three year old grandchild has one of these hats, like Totoro, and it's cute. Why do people want to be seen as adults (in too many bad ways) yet cling to childhood well into their late 20's and sometimes longer? My theory is they cannot deal with the present harsh realities - which I can understand - but living in la la land will not help."," However, there is one look that I'm afraid makes me come over a little bit fascist A little bit, Hadley, a little bit ?"," To make a woman look like a child is to make her unthreatening, helpless and worthy of condescension. When women dress like children, they encourage this attitude. Wrong Hadley. When you accept this attitude you encourage it.That animal hats make and are meant to make women untreathening is only your opinion and your interpretation. They may just say I like animals, I'd like to look like one. Do not apologise for being grown women. Who says they are? Stop projecting your own attitudes on women Hadley! And oh, yes, get a sense of humor!"," I'll wear a f**king pointy party hat with streamers on if I want to, and no patronising killjoy of a columnist making insidious comments about 'apologising for being a woman' etc will stop me."," I have a leopard print hat with ears. It's cute, it makes me smile, and just this weekend an elderly lady told me how happy it made her. I don't care if I look like a kid; I like it :)"," You ignore the fact that these are cheap and warm, easy to wear and easily available. More grown up alternatives are often expensive for what they are or distinctly unflattering. Not all of us buy our clothes solely on the grounds of appearance. By the way, I don't have such a hat, I wear a North Face Hi-point hat with ear flaps when I really need to keep my ears warm. It isn't pretty or cute but it does the job. But I could have bought three of these animal hats for its price."," I too think grow the f-up when I see these. Seeing people wearing them past the mid twenties is just embarassing, seriously people grow up. Right, I'm off to play with my Star Wars figures."," Terrible article. Choose battles, please.", I am 65. I sometimes wear a child's necklace and usually children's slides in my hair. I like candy-coloured or stripey socks with trousers. Why can't clothes be fun? Stuff fashionable correctness.," Sorry, Hadley, this is really tantamount to bullying. It happens every day and you just threw another stone. I usually love your columns and revel in your wit - but you are totally off the mark here. There is nothing wrong with men or women dressing like children/animals/another gender/space aliens/etc. If you feel so anxious about a grown woman wearing a cute animal hat that should bring a smile to inhabitants of a jaded and cruel world, please, get over your miserable childhood. Should women stop wearing animal prints because that is also childlish? What next? Only Marks and Spencer one you are over 30. No bright yellow, since it might clash with your respectability? How dull! I would expect this from several Guardian writers, but not from your lovely and adorable self. Now please, get a few of those fluffy faux-fur hats, put one on your head and give a few to your co-workers. Tell them to wear the hats regularly - to meetings, outside, at home. Once you realise how silly &quot;dressing professional&quot; is - how silly WORK itself is - you will see a whole new world of fun, kindness and positivity open up before you. Now where did I put my Doraemon sweater..."," My daughter has been gunning for one of these things for a while, but my wife takes the same dim view of them as you, Hadley. Finally, for her tenth birthday last month she was given one by a relative. Delighted with it for a few days but style-conscious to her bones, she has since started letting her seven-year-old sister wear it while she reverts to the sequinned beret that or flap-eared woolly hat that she was wearing before. Nuff said.", I have just added 'animal hat with attached mittens to my shopping list.' Apart from being excellent fun they look rather cosy., Totally agree. I'd include ballet dancers as well. I know ballet is considered an art form . . but please . . grown women in tutus ? Parading around on their tippy toes ? Neither gymnasts or actors or musicians. Just silly., Do not apologise for being grown women. It is great to be a woman! Yes. Thank you Hadley!," I bet Hadley would look lovely in a fluffy hat with a single ear above the brim. It's just an update of the Davy Crockett hat. You could be forgiven for thinking that as a USAian, Hadley might be all for the 'wild front ear' look.", Clearly the way forward is for all humans to wear funny hats all the time. That way lies universal peace and happiness. Going without trousers would help too.," I feel sorry for any women out there that do wear cute animal hats, and really like them and the whole Neo-Japanese thing that’s big at the moment, who then read a joyless, nasty little article like this and are made to feel stupid, or as though they’re letting their whole sex down. Knocking women for what they wear, whatever it might be, is just plain bitchiness. All an article like this can do is spread a little more misery about. It petty, vindictive and I resent it. (Also, nobody would ever write something like this aimed at men who wear superhero shirts or whatever, so it’s sexist too, for whatever that’s worth.)"," Oh Grow up you silly silly woman and get yourself a sense of humour. My daughter sent me this link calling you a pillock - as endorsed by many of the above comments. I've brought her up to be conscious and free and whoever she may be, and that includes wearing whatever she wants. You're just someone else telling women what to wear and how they should look, you're an idiot."," Pssh. My Mum is 62 and she's just bought a fluffy faux wolf-hat to wear after seeing people wearing them around London and thinking they were great. She'll wear it because she likes it and because she doesn't give a s**t. She also likes to wear sequins. And she still hennas her hair ginger red. She worked in the civil service for 30 years. Think you know what a person is like because of the hat they wear? Grow up, Hadley. Wear whatever you damn well please, ladies. And enjoy it.", Writer ain't got no sensayuma! There are lots if serious issues to worry about. A list can be provided if you're stuck.....," I'm a feminist (yes, I said it out loud!) and I agree with some of your points about the unfair pressures of ageing on women, and that we are not taken seriously enough. I do not agree with the hat thing. I don't have one, but do sport North Face woolly ear flaps (very warm) and no, don't want a muppet on my head. I know this is not meant to be a serious article, but it raises some serious points. I would say that the point of equality is that whoever you are and whatever you choose to wear you are a person who should be respected. (Alright, hygiene and dress codes should be met, but, animal hats are casual wear, I don't think many nurses sport them on ward rounds!) Any concerns about what clothing we wear is just cave-man tribal nonsense anyway, invented by humans so they can phone up inane TV shows and vote people off because we don't like their hair. I wear whatever I choose, and should be treated with respect, and I don't have to dress like a super-model, a man, or a rabbit to expect that. Also, when I leave the house it is often because I have some errand to run for my own needs, and I honestly couldn't give two tosses what some other person thinks about that, or if they live or die for that matter, as indeed, I hope they don't give a damn about me. If not, they seriously need to evaluate why they care. If we want to be equal, we have to stop caring about what judgemental people 'think'.", One more thing. a few columns back -&gt; 28 Jan 2013: One of the things feminism is about is freedom – and that means being able to choose what you feel comfortable wearing Or does that not stretch to wearing things you don't like?, Get yourself a miserable cow hat Hadley. Or let me know where to send it!," you're not going to make me ditch my hello kitty wallet for a prada one, forget it, you little fascist."," Completely offended by this article! Yes I am a strong, intelligent and independent woman and I wear Japanese Lolita fashion and animal hats because I think they are cute and I like them!"," C.S. Lewis had a nice quote that I feel is relevant to this matter: Critics who treat adult as a term of approval, instead of as a merely descriptive term, cannot be adult themselves. To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence. And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early adulthood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development. When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly. When I became an adult I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up."," . Stop fearing adulthood by dressing like a child and stop thinking that you should make yourselves all ickle wickle with no opinions of any value because you're just a little girly-girl in your animal hat with attached paws. I think you're over-thinking it. Why would you assume that just cos someone wears an animal hat, they're trying to give the impression that they &quot;have &quot;no opinions of any value&quot;? Seems a pretty stupid thing to say (although I'm not saying you shouldn't have an opinion on the matter).", What is it with you Hadley? Poor women spend most of their time told what to wear by men through subtle manipulation and now you come along and presume to tell them what to wear. What about wearing what makes you happy? Oh I guess if that happened you'd be out of a job...," There's something that actually trumps these hats: Grown women talking in a baby voice. Add ...'in front of men' or '....at work' to that, and you've got yourself something quite spectacularly rank."," This rant is really critical and insulting as it simply assumes the personalities of the hundreds and hundreds of women who don this fashion. Ever stopped to think they might be just keeping themselves warm. Much better than the people you see wearing next to nothing and heels on nights out in the snow, with some who end up hospitalised because of their lack of common sense and therefore costing the NHS money for mistakes which they could have easily prevented themselves. I don't think grown women who wear these hats are trying to portray themselves as a little girl, maybe they just like the design and the animal on it. And they certainly are not afraid of growing up, they are just having what they like in their lives and not adhering to the ridiculous social conventions that we follow. Its almost like children at school saying what is cool and what is not, so surely by writing this rant you are immature for not being accepting of others. I think if guys wear animal hats people think it is funny, meanwhile women wear it and they are obviously are childish and immature and should really grow up... Being a grown-up does not mean that you have to throw away what you enjoy and like, instead being a grown-up entails a lot more things such as being thoughtful and understanding of the variety of opinions and people there are out they and being socially accepting of everyone.", Grow up...? I'm a grown up and it's sh*t!," It's women like Hadley, whose definition of &quot;serious womanhood &quot; is so narrow , that are the problem."," Yup, forget burkas, bikinis and high heels, it's cute animal hats that are the prime enemy of womankind in this globalist, capitalistic, patriarchalist, oppressionistical regime."," You are strong, smart, intelligent women and you should not apologise for that. Some people actually are stupid, though. Statistically speaking, half of the people out there have below average IQs. I say, let those people wear animal hats and we can spot them a mile off.", Petty criticism of other peoples' dress sense is as childish as it gets. Grow up and get over it., So much more grown-up to balance upon improbably high spiked heels so loved in fashion mags and ads I suppose: what does fashion have to do with sense or practicality? Your sneering tone is somewhat unpleasant as is the idea that anyone who fails to heed your advice is somehow deficient.," I actually have the opposite reaction when I see grown women wearing obviously silly clothes like animal hats. I feel like it's a nice relief to see a woman who has the confidence to appear geeky, who is not so constantly obsessed with her image and sex appeal and 'coolness' and is willing to just put something on because she enjoys it. To me it kind of sends the message that if anyone thinks less of them for it it's that person's problem."," Is Cameron's Brittain not miserable enough without you getting uppity and telling folks they can't have a bit of harmless fun? Go! wear a silly hat for a day. You might actually get some decent material for a column out of it, instead of sitting home like a grump and re-hashing a piece wot-you-rote last year..."," Most mornings, I drive past a lady who has a hat with ears on it. It makes me smile; indeed it is one of the few bright spots in an otherwise depressingly bleak and frustrating daily routine. I think we should have more hats with ears."," &quot;To make a woman look like a child is to make her unthreatening, helpless and worthy of condescension.&quot; - I get where she is coming from but I still think anyone can wear animal hats if they like. You can very well be doing it because you like an animal hat, you think it's cute, and it suits you or whatever. Don't tell women what they can and cannot do because it's quite ok for grown up men to love Spiderman, comic books, and go-karts. And no one accuses them of being helpless and worthy of condescension. I think the biggest error in this whole argument is that women are wearing those hats FOR someone, for men in particular. No one says that men like comic books FOR women or that it has anything to do with women. Oh no, men can do things and like things and with no relation to women. And it's time for women to be granted the same privilege.", i like animal hats on everyone yes it is playful and fun that dosnt mean its childish. I particularly like when care and attention has gone into picking a certain animal almost trying to show it as a native american spirt animal sort of symbol of them, i like them, I'm reading this wearing my cat outfit.," Look, fashion is supposed to be fun. It is supposed to be joyful. It is supposed to be about allowing people to express a certain side of themselves, to experiment with different looks, to enjoy their creativity. Really? I always thought it was meant to make women so insecure about their bodies that they would rack up the credit cards on overpriced rags that would be declared outdated in six months. Other than arms dealers and maybe sex traffickers- fashion is about as miserable, and profitable, industry as you can get."," God Hadley so judgemental as of late ignoring individuals choices to wear animal based hats. I personally like them but then i'm awesome and enjoy Adventure Time if you dislike them on women I imagine you loathe them on men so I won't be sharing any images of this epic look on my person. Of course there is a long tradition of this look in Northern Europe usually of boar, wolf and stag invoking the animal as garb worn by our ancestors as they wen't hunting and fought battles. Its an old school tribal look updated to the knitted variety."," Wow. Your fashion is obviously limited. People should be able to express themselves however they want. And not have people like you having rants about them wearing anime hats..... Having a rant like this isn't going to stop people from dressing how they want, it just annoys people.

I have grown up lady hats and gloves and sometimes I wear them, and sometimes I wear my panda or cat hat. Why? Because I friggin' want to, thank you. Hat Nazi!"," As a smart, intelligent woman I'm not apologising for anything. I'm wearing an awesome hat. I can't understand why people make such a fuss out of what others wear. Surely it's my choice to have a fuzzy hat or not? Buying &quot;normal&quot; things because I was told to in an article sounds more like apologising for who I am than my awesome bear hat!"," I'm female, the CEO of a several companies, and it just so happens that I love cute fashion items - such as these 'horrifying' animal hats. If you think wearing cute clothes makes someone childish, so be it. But do be aware that by dressing this way, people are in no way denouncing their 'adult woman' status. It's all contextual, everyone knows when to be mature, but it's knowing when to be 'childish' too that truly makes an adult in my opinion. People have their own styles Hadley, do you think anyone wearing an animal hat thinks 'Oh no, someone is going to think I'm childish!'?

In the age of the brand a new mindset has taken hold of the masses, one in which we are all ""worth"" the right phone, the right name on the sweatshirt, the right colour sole on a shoe. As a result, luxury has proved remarkably resilient, even during economic downturns.

The response of brands has been, of course, to put prices up. And then put them up again. Because if you can, why wouldn't you, right? In 2005, a Mulberry Bayswater handbag cost £495; today it sells for double that. It has become quite common for designer names – and not just the storied likes of Hermès and Gucci, but essentially run-of-the-mill designer names – to talk of including a few ""entry-level"" price points below £1,000, ""for younger customers"". A whole new category has been invented, that of the £100 trinket – the keyring, the iPhone cover, sometimes literally a trinket to swing from a bag – allowing consumers to ""buy into"" a brand.

But the extraordinary price rises of the past decade have left a gap in the market. Anyone who ever sets foot beyond Sloane Street will observe that there are a huge number of stylish, fashion-conscious women who do not – will not and, crucially, cannot – pay £1,000-plus for a handbag. Another fact immediately obvious once you look around the real world is that almost every single woman needs a handbag. So while a woman might splurge £100 on a trinket from her favourite brand, she is still in the market for a bag.

This is where Michael Kors comes in. You'll have seen the name around, on the streets of London or Leeds. Spelt out in gold capitals, the Michael Kors logo swings from the arm of women who have just had a promotion and bought themselves a smart bag with their first pay cheque, from women whose friends have clubbed together to buy her a bag for her birthday. The bestselling Michael Michael Kors Selma bag sells for £260; this year's updated version, the Sophie, for £345. The structured silhouette draws on the mythology of the Hermès Birkin – trademark, Greatest Bag Of All Time – while the contrasting colours used on the lozenge-shaped sides of the Sophie, along with the zip and deep-set handle stitchings, appeal to a fashion-savvy consumer who has had images of the Céline range etched on her retina over the past few years but can't afford the £1,500 price tag.

But to succeed in the affordable It bag market, a bag needs to be aspirational as well as affordable. The bags funnel the gloss of the high-end Michael Kors brand, whose New York fashion week catwalk show is always a fiesta of front-row socialites, creating a name that feels glamorous to a hungry British audience. (The name of the more inexpensive ""Michael"" Michael Kors brand seems designed to deliberately blur the line with the more pricey Michael Kors line. This is a contrast to, for example, Miu Miu, which has a standalone name and identity from the Prada mothership.) When Mulberry was selling handbags for under £500, Kate Moss was wearing them; I recently saw the beautiful young British model Malaika Firth, a current Vogue favourite, carrying a Michael Michael Kors Selma on to a plane. Miranda Kerr, Jessica Alba and Selena Gomez have all been photographed with Selmas and Sophies.

Images of women like this looking blow-dried at airports are key to the appeal of the brand. Certain themes recur when retailers talk about what their customers love about Michael Kors: ""The Harrods clients respond to the glamorous lifestyle that the Michael Kors brand represents,"" says Simon Longland, Harrods' head of fashion accessories. At John Lewis, where the brand is now a top seller in both handbags and watches – a market where, similarly, prices of the top names have spiralled out of reach of all but the tiniest number – head buyer Amanda Scott feels her customer ""loves the luxury lifestyle Michael Kors offers"".

The Michael Kors brand is unusual in luxury in that it prides itself on being democratic. There are a wide range of price points and the company's most recent high-profile hire, announced earlier this month, is the arrival of Cathy Marie Robinson as a senior vice president and global operations. Robinson, who began her career in the army, currently holds an equivalent position at Toys'R'Us. But interestingly, both Longland and Scott describe the Michael Michael Kors bags as ""iconic"". As well as clever brand positioning and smart marketing – and the open goal left in the British market by the likes of Mulberry – the aesthetic of the Selma and Sophie bags has played a huge role in their success.

Where the initial Mulberry It bags were built on utilitarian references – the Bayswater is a reimagining of a doctor's bag – the Selma and the Sophie, with their nods to Hermès and to Céline, place themselves in the lineage of sleek, international power dressing. ""Jet set"" is a phrase the brand uses frequently, and the bags merge classic travel references with their contemporary equivalents. The look is part Jackie Kennedy on the steps of Air Force One, part Miranda Kerr at LAX. The details are right: the gold studs on the base, a practical touch so that you can rest the bag on the floor; a printed silk lining; a phone pocket. But the most important detail is very, very simple: the magic £300 price tag.",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/may/20/michael-kors-bags-afforable-luxury#comments," what extraordinary rubbish this is. how can a handbag that cost 300 pounds be democratic? How about promoting the idea that it is just a bag, dammit, and wanting it to look expensive is pretty shallow? Surely the guardian of all papers should not be taking the rank idiocy of spending all that money on a container so seriously.", £300 for a bag is stupid as £1000 for a bag., 300 quid for a handbag is ludicrous!," Wow, you really do live in a different world where £300 for a bag is considered the affordable option for the cash strapped bag lover and sub £1000 is 'entry level'!", £300 for a handbag? I don't even have £300 to put into a handbag!!, I get my handbags from charity shops - I've had some lovely ones - and I would never pay £300 for a handbag if I was rich as Croesus., I am defined by my handbag? There lies a problem.," It's all relative to how much use you can get out of a bag isn't it? I bought myself an Ally Capelino bag (backpack) about 8 years ago for £200, The quality of it is outstanding, it looks as good now (a bit worn but that adds to the charm) as it did when I got it and I use it loads. So that's £25 per year for something that looks good, is well made, is a classic and is functional. Is that bad value? Or is it better value to buy something crap for £50 and have to replace it every a year? If these £300 bags are made to a high standard and last the test of time then in 20 years that's £15 per year.

Plus that pink handbag is hideous.," The luxury brand industry is one of the biggest frauds of all time, whether it is bags, perfumes, jewellery or clothes. The mark up defies logic especially when some if not most of the goods are made in Asian sweatshops. Paying 1500 pounds for a crumpled jacket is pure madness. But as the 1% take home more money than they can spend in a lifetime they do not care how much things cost for snob value. Cars, art and property have followed the same pattern. But the clients of luxury brand stores, which are always empty, except for a security guard and salesperson who spends the day moving or folding stock, are often those who tend to spend other people's money before they are arrested for fiddling, corruption or tax fraud.", Three hundred quid for a handbag while people are starving? Why are many of us increasingly defined by the brands on our gear? Marketing brain washing? Real men wear their labels on the inside. ( Except Levis of course)," I have been aware of the 'bag thing' for about ten years. That is 'aware that people, mainly women, regard them as some kind of status signifier. The point is quite odd, because when I meet a women, in whatever conmtext, I never look at her handbag, let alone squint to see if there is a gucci or hermes or mulberry tag. In all seriousness, does anyone meet someone and judge them in any way by their accoutrements. This is a subtle thing, of course, but one of the possible judgements is that this person has a poor understanding of what is 'valued' or has values which may or may not be appealing. someone 'using' such an object to signify( it must be a social signifier) carries a lot of negative risks. Even if you are moving in the social circles where people routinely spend a lot on such personal geegaws-you are enteringh that socila milieu at the 'bottom' i.e. brand obsesses people will simply say that a cheap Michael Kors is not the real thing.It is the expense that is the thing. Someone sporting a bunch of designery stuff without a lot of other contextual signs risks looking very silly. I will make a prediction. The whole 'brand puff' expense marketing thing is going to 'largely' collapse at some point.(It will revert to near invisibility-becuase as soon as it becomes visible it loses its cachet. Mulberry will become devalued.It cant have a high street shop with items made in China without being seen through. It is trading on quite untenable ideas which are not supported by matters related to cost and value. There really is not much social return on an expensive bag-that is the fundamental advertising myth which is now on its last legs.

As he said, if you have to tell people who &quot;Michael&quot; is, you just haven't made it."," I've always thought Michael Kors was very clever with the pricing and marketing of his bags - they're beautiful, good quality and at a perfect mid-price. The only comparable bag brand is Furla. I would pay more for a Chanel or Hermes bag, but not a Mulberry bag."," People are entitled to spend their money however they choose. But when buying a luxury fashion item, do they really know what they are getting? Many cars, electronics and expensive household goods are tested and heavily critiqued by specialty media.

Prefer the Mulberry bags., I'm sorry but the people who can afford those bags do not read The Guardian.," I got a Michael Kors bag for Christmas, and I love it. Used it everyday since still in really good condition, considering the battering it takes. I am probably in the demographic for a Michael Kors bag, can't afford a Mulberry at the moment, but want a bag that looks smart and professional for work. Previously I had used a Zara bag or a Longchamp one. I do love handbags, own a few at all price ranges and the most important thing to me is that they are long lasting and look good. I prefer to look stylish over fashionable so as long as a bag/outfit looks good to me I will use/wear it for many years until it falls apart. I still use a Nine West Handbag I got 8 years ago that is still in perfect condition."," At least the bags look stylish now, unlike those horrible big clunky bags with lots of chains etc - which just looked ugly. A well made bag will last for years - so is actually a good investment if you've totally fallen for it.

They've successfully alienated their once loyal following, and the new designs reflect the markets they are now designing for. The 'old' Mulberry was a company that prided itself on craftsmanship and quality, the Michael Kors bags look fine just tacky for the price tag and I'm sure the quality isn't great.

Loving the irony of the judgy comments above saying that you don't look at other people's bags or general appearance- apparently you just wait till to make comment on them online."," The word luxury is over used. We are talking about bags. Things to put other things on so you can carry them and it doesn't matter how expensive the bag is, things still have to be carried and they don't feel any lighter in expensive sacks. If you need your bag to make a statement about you, don't be surprised if the message it sends is you're a fool who thinks over spending on poorly made goods in the same sweatshops as high street goods makes you feel better because you have low self esteem."," The bag must be well made, and made locally, hence the price tag."," From a purely business point of view, I question how &quot;in reach&quot; £300 is.

It used to mean that something/someone had stood the test of time. A Chanel 2.55 bag and and Hermes Birkin are iconic. A Michael Kors bag a few years old is not.

How the fashion industry decides who is knocking off and gets sued and who is 'inspired' by would make an interesting article."," Most people would draw the line at wearing a fur coat, but are happy to carry a leather bag. so I cannot imagine why a leather bag would be OK, like fur leather always looks better on the animal than adorning someone.

Crumpled in the back of the cupboard, tangled up with six of its contemporaries, covered in Rorschach test-like blotches owing to long-departed leaky biros, its saggy lines seem to suggest the very opposite of the ambition and drive encapsulated by a true fashion purchase.

In reality, the tote bag can be just as potent a status symbol as a monogrammed Louis Vuitton handbag. And, unlike the clutch bags and party shoes that gather dust in the wardrobe, this is fashion that you will actually wear – particularly since the 5p charge for plastic carrier bags in England made a pariah of anyone who habitually fails to bring their own.

Tote bag semantics are complex. Even a wildly overpriced canvas sack is pretty cheap, so this is not about money – or not directly, at least. Just as 2015’s curated Instagram feeds are a careful balance of fancy dress and #artselfies, your tote is a measure of your lifestyle as a whole – choosing one is a question of knowledge, access and taste.

For a long time, in fashion circles, Daunt Books’ sturdy bottle-green bag (£8) was the high watermark of chic – a trend that began when model Anouck Lepère was snapped carrying one during fashion week in 2008. Subtly decorated, so that only the initiated would recognise it from a distance, Daunt Books’ website offers a possibly auto-parodic proclamation of its merits: “The only way to spot fellow literary lovers in a remote Tuscan village.” Seven years later, proper fashion and literary types would probably dismiss it as a bit too obvious. Instead, the repeated monochrome motif of the Lutyens & Rubinstein Bookshop has the edge, partially for reasons of exclusivity: L&R has just one store as opposed to Daunt’s six.

Tote bags can signal your postcode with GPS-like accuracy. In Walthamstow, east London, it’s all about a William Morris Gallery tote or a Toy Library anniversary bag. Five miles south-west, in Highbury, you’re no one without a La Fromagerie sack. Another eight miles further south and “I heart Brockley” bags – inevitably made from organic Fairtrade cotton – are all the rage.

That Brockley bag would not win you friends with the fashion or the art crowd – it’s far too cheerful and way too obvious. And if you truly knew your art, you would never grab the £12 Royal Academy gift shop tote on your way out from Ai Weiwei – that’s about as naff as a souvenir tea towel. Instead, you cart your spare shoes to work in a free tote from PAD art fair previews; the kind of canvas that only contacts and status can procure. Further cultural bragging rights come courtesy of a “Judd” bag, signalling that you are one of the lucky few to have toured Donald Judd’s apartment in New York; or in the music industry, it’s all about a bag from End of the Road festival or the XL music bag from SXSW. But totes are tribal; those that get you covetous looks in some circles won’t work in others. My own favourite is a green, striped plastic launderette-style bag with a subtle Marni logo. While a select handful of fashion types will swoon when I use it, others shoot me daggers, clearly thinking I have brought my dirty laundry to work.

Unforgivable are the totes that come free with bulk buys at Superdrug, many of which are emblazoned with a perky, sick-making slogan (#lovinlife; #blessed; 100% gorgeous!). The use of hashtag here is particularly worrying, suggesting that the bag’s designer and its user have lost the ability to differentiate between social media and real life.

Having such a bag floating around in your cupboard to mop up paint stains in the future is a high-risk strategy: you may pull it out by accident in a pre-work panic. Turning it inside out will not redeem it; the letters will show through the canvas and draw attention to your attempts to mask your embarrassment – and the last thing you want to do is look as if you are trying too hard.

Because remember: your tote bag should appear to be something you happened to have to hand because you’ve just decanted some incredibly expensive cheese. The backroom effort and minute planning required to achieve this happy accident must remain entirely secret. Totes casual, indeed.",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/nov/16/totes-canvas-bag-marni-cheese-shop-self-image-tribe#comments," What my shopping bag says about me is that I once shopped at Sainsbury's.

While bookshops, technology retailers and music stores all suffered, barbers have bucked the economic downturn. More than 150 new shops opened in the UK last year, a 6.24% rise, according to figures from the Local Data Company (LDC). Fashion is a key explanation of the leap in numbers, particularly the popularity of retro 1920s and 1950s cuts with short or shaved back and sides and a styled top that require regular return visits to keep in shape.

There's the ""ivy league"" – a classic short cut, which can be smooth on top or ""textured"", as worn by Arsenal footballer Aaron Ramsey and Twilight star Robert Pattinson. Or the ""varsity"" side parting – trimmed at the sides and back and groomed on top. A shorter version of the 1950s quiff – David Beckham's latest look – is also hugely popular. Or for a rather more radical look there's the ""fusey"" cut – shaved sides and long on top – favoured by Joey Essex from the TV soap The Only Way Is Essex.

Film stars and footballers – like Beckham, Gareth Bale, Xabi Alonso and Theo Walcott – are the big style icons. ""Whatever Beckham has, people follow him,"" says Paul Taylor of Taylor Taylor barbers in Sheffield, which was set up by his grandfather in 1927. He says the latest trends demand greater use of clippers and shaving equipment that can only be found at a barber's. ""Guys recognise it's a skilful profession quite different from a women's hairdresser's,"" says Taylor.

Mike Taylor, director of the British Barbers Association, says: ""Men are looking after themselves a lot more and have finally realised that the barber is the best person to cut their hair, not a hairdresser."" He says the male grooming industry as a whole grew by 3% last year – not bad during a recession.

Karen Waldron, the owner of Berkhamsted-based the Barber Shop Group, which has 12 shops, says barbers are booming during the economic downturn as men look for a cheaper option than the unisex salons they might have used in the past. ""They don't want to go to Toni & Guy, it's too expensive,"" she says. On the other hand, men are more willing to spend money on pampering themselves, with rising demand for hot-towel shaves and waxing.

Another driver behind the barber boom is economics. As other retailers close down, barbers are able to get rent-free or low-rent deals on small shops in a way that wouldn't have been possible before the financial crash. ""Lots of people don't want these little shop units, which are an ideal size for barbers,"" says Matthew Hopkinson of LDC.

As a result the number of barbers on high streets and in shopping centres has grown by 8%, while growth on local shopping parades is slower and the number of barbers in out-of-town retail parks has fallen.

With no requirement for a licence or qualifications, it is relatively cheap, quick and easy to set up mirrors, chairs and clippers, making a barber shop an attractive option for those who find themselves out of work or looking to start their own business. The BBA has been trying to improve standards and introduce a licensing system to prevent untrained barbers from opening up and undercutting established businesses. It says new rivals are a cause of concern for barbers who have invested in years of training and investment.

Waldron, who set up her own business 31 years ago after becoming one of the first female barbers trained in a traditional shop when she was 16, says her salons have faced increasing competition as some of her own staff have left to set up their own businesses nearby. Aylesbury, for example, now has eight barbers. ""They're all people I've trained,"" she says. ""Everybody thinks it's a quick buck, but in many cases they have just saturated a town.""

Fierce competition keeps prices down. Philip Ashia of Active Barbers in Tooting, south London, says he has seen more than five barbers open up nearby in the last year alone and business has been tricky as customers try out new rivals.

His afro shop is something of a local social club, as shown in the YouTube hit Smokey's Barbers. He stays open until late and has created an atmosphere that keeps people coming back. ""Lots of guys just come to hang out, but they often end up having their hair cut,"" he says.",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/jun/02/barbers-high-street-men-retro#comments, &quot;and how would you like your hair cut sir?&quot; &quot;in complete silence&quot;, Going anywhere nice for your holidays?," Something for the weekend , sir ?", Perhaps traditional hairstyles reflect the deeply conservative age in which we live., Neat hair is back – one reason why 150 men's hairdressers have opened in Britain in the past year ALERT BORIS JOHNSON!!!," Did barbers ever go away then? I certainly didn't notice it. There have been a few more pop up recently where I live but all the new ones seem empty when I walk past to get to mine who is just as busy as he always was. That reminds me, getting a little shaggy."," &quot;Guys recognise it's a skilful profession quite different from a women's hairdresser's,&quot; says Taylor. Sorry, what?", Were men really going to Toni &amp; Guy for a haircut?," Most of the barbers I see in London tend to be twenty or thirty-something second generation immigrants - blacks, Turks, Greeks etc. I wonder if rather than resurrecting the traditional British barbershop, they're importing the traditions from their parent's homelands? Having lived in Spain for a number of years, they feel closer in atmosphere to the barbers I used in Spain - meeting places as much as barbers, often with friends just hanging out, having a chat, or watching the telly, with the business almost fitting in around the social side. Personally I think it's a good thing - far better than the old bloke with the Brylcreamed hair and white coat. The only problem is they all seem to be Spurs supporters...."," I don't advise a haircut, man. All hairdressers are in the employment of the government. Hair are you aerials. They pick up signals from the cosmos and transmit them directly into the brain.

If history repeats itself, in five years they will all look like Flock of Seragulls"," Last time I went to the barber's, I asked for a number 2.

I've been to a salon ONCE out of necessity (my Turkish barber had a very long queue and we were heading off on hol's so I had no choice. Honest!)..

The offer of a cup of coffee is a warning sign. RUN!, I'll be nipping into Tony's in Streatham (special journey) on Tuesday for a proper haircut. He has a picture of Lady Di on the wall and a deep interest in conspiracy theories. The only barber I know who has the Guardian among the papers available while you're waiting.," Only having three hairs, I just asked for a trim. The barber then asked how I normally wore it, I said &quot;side shed&quot;, but here he panicked when one hair fell out. I said &quot;it's ok, just put it in a middle parting&quot;. But another fell out. He said &quot;what do I do now, you've only one left&quot; ? I said &quot;just blow it back&quot;.", Tesco etc will see this trend and probably decide to target it by setting up salons in stores - and then for the first time in history we will be able to get a trim on a Sunday.," The problem is the modern barbers isn't a barbers at all, rather cut price hairdressers. I get sick of the time they spend on my hair, I had some trainee spend 50 minutes on a not-quite-as-short short-back and sides. Wanted to tell him to hurry up, didn't want to be rude. But honestly, what's with the diagonal cuts, and the strange scissors. They act like landscape gardeners crafting a hedge, ducking and diving around the back of your head. I remember when I used to get my hair cut when I was younger, clattered and bruised with a heavy pair of scissors and shorn like a lamb. Over and done in 5 minutes, wonderful.", Isn't the main difference between a barber and a stylist how much they charge you?," It probably reflects the era in which I grew up, but I think a lot of men look good with short hair. My preference has always been a male barber who gets on with it; a little conversation, maybe, but quickly in and out is to my liking."," no-one I know regularly goes to anywhere other than a barbers. £8's my average cut cost, an I'd never breach the £12 ceiling. It's a question of false value: no haircut should cost £30+ it's just folk believing they're paying for quality, rather than being fleeced.", &quot;The return of the short back and sides&quot; I dont get it? my son and his friends have always had close crops going back to the year dot (often with some motif or pattern shaved into the cut somewhere). black barbers have always been popular. So this is a 'white thing' one assumes?," I haven't used a hair salon in years and I'm female. I really hate the girly ambience in salons, and I hate their exorbitant prices even more. I just go for a short back and sides - same every time - as my fine flyaway hair results in constant bad hair days if it's forced into a style. The barber doesn't try and persuade me out of it, he just does what I want. As I have to wash my hair every day, I'm glad of the low maintenance hairstyle. He also has an amusing line of patter which I can join in or not as I please - none of the stilted coversations about holidays. I've noticed the younger generation of women have also discovered the advantages of using a barber, the number of female clients seems to have increased every time I pay my 6 weekly visit.", Just one thing.

WHF!," By happy co-incidence I've just come back form my local barber for a trim. Lots of barbers open here in north London, mine is Turkish and is Ali. Seriously."," I'm getting a little shaggy myself, better not stand too close to you, maybe someone will think I'm one of the band..."," I have noticed more and more around - finding a good one - even if challenged in the hair department - is difficult I had a great barber in Pimlico - run by a couple of guys from eastern europe and after much trial and error found a good one here in Bristol just by Colston Hall. The main problems is lack of detail care and not finishing properly with tapering and the like - something that means the cut lasts longer - esp when a &quot;short number one&quot; goes &quot;fluffy&quot; very quickly. Good news, having a short tidy hair cut means a very quick wash and dry in the morning!"," Let's look at this historically: Great Depression 1930's Hair: Short 1956, 1961 Hair: Short Mid 1970s recession 1973-75 Hair: Started long, getting generally shorter into the late 70's. Early 1980s recession 1980-82 Hair: Short- sideburns had disappeared, moustaches were starting to be shaved off. Early 1990s recession 1990-92 Hair: Getting longer 2000s recession 2008-11 Hair: Getting shorter Men's hair was at its longest from 1967-1970- but the economy peaked before 1967 and troughed in 1974, at which point hair was still worn quite long. There was a period of economic uncertainty in 1979, prior to falling into recession as a result of ultra-monetarism. Various skinhead sub-cultures reached their height in the late 1970's, as a reaction against the hippiedom of the previous generation of youth. In the early 1990s, interest in the 1960s started to increase from around 1989 to 1996, when it was endemic, and then faded away again from 1997. In the 1960s, long hair was worn by men who aimed to reject the mainstream and consumerist society, or at least to look as if they did. In the 2000s-2010s, long hair was worn by people like this.", I'm sorry but every time I see the red and white pole I think of Sweeney Todd............, can we blame this on the cuts ...our barbers not cutting hair any longer ..he`s cutting it shorter ...," Don't like this trend at all. I like men with long hair (or at least longish), the messier the better (picture: Ed Turner, lead singer of Pegasus Bridge , who has ideal hair). Naturally, it would be my generation that wants short hair. Well, trends can change and not everybody is a slave to fashion.", I'd just like a barber who listens to what I ask for. My request for a trim - even a light trim - is invariably followed by an attempt to give me a skinhead cut. I dread to think of the result if I asked for it short!," I may be far off the mark here, but perhaps it has something to do with the average wealth of people. I've lived in a few countries where the average income is pretty low, and when compared to 'wealthy' countries you tend to find far more hairdressers/barbers. I always saw it as a cheap bit of pampering. When the purse strings are tight, you cannot go out and treat yourself to anything expensive, but you can treat yourself to a minor image change. In general I think we all tend to feel better after a good hair cut. So perhaps the sudden increase in barbers is down to people wanting a cheap joy.", Always been a barbers man myself. We have a couple of salons in my town but I'm no lady. When you just want a short back and sides style hair cut there isn't much need for fancy hairdressing.," visited Brent Cross last week for the first time in ages - there was a barbers shop in the middle of the upper concourse - and it was packed! ok, it was half-term and there were loads of kids, but there was a queue..."," Loathe him or love him, Joey Barton is another footballer who has sported quality barbershop hair-dos.", I have a number 1.

Yes time and a half thats 30 quid.," This is Scotland and the friendly local Turkish barber will shear you on a Sunday, hurrah.

Mmmmm.", https://www.facebook.com/pages/Barberspolecom/107557662684789," If you want a wide choice of barber try visiting Edinburgh. Go along Leith Walk and turn into Great Junction Street for the biggest selection of tonsorial talent in Europe (at least in my limited experience). My son favours the the Nut Hoose (Kurdish, he says)just past Ferry Road, but the Best Little Hairhouse in Town has its supporters too. I think there must be as many barbers as pubs. Why? Well, the men of Leith do seem to favour short hair, and it is unlikely they would have to wait long for attention.", Yeah ... the extensive use of clippers covers up the very fact that barbers today do not know how to cut hair properly and they definitely do not know how to use scissors. It's no wonder that everyone is walking around with the generic no.1 or no.3 haircut. There is no room today for individual thinking just keep on following the follower!," Barbers never went away. The Italians are still in force, in many towns/cities. There are many salons which state they are barbers, but are just men/women wielding clippers. There are a few real tonsorial experts, who also shave and, moisturise men's faces, and also cut/style hair, use neck/shoulder protectors, dusting powder/brush and take their time to perfect a style for their clients. Mon copain has his hair cut by a great Italian barber.", Day off work today?, there's also a seedy side to the growth. Small service based businesses like this are increasingly being used to launder cash. Clearly this won't account for the bulk of the growth but it's a factor. There's an attraction in using hairdressers and barbers for this kind of activity as there's often someone wanting to do the job who can develop enough of a customer base to provide cover and they can often be quite social with people dropping in and out without that being seen as odd. Not massively capital intensive either.," The last time I went to the barber's, or any other professional setup, it cost me two shillings.", In the early nineties I had one of those big undercut styles. Long as I could manage on top and shaved on the back and sides. With a center parting you couldnt tell the sides were shaves at all. Then I got a job interview with the civil service and realised that there was no chance in hell of getting the job with that haircut. So for the first and only time in my life I went to a &quot;salon&quot; to get it sorted out. I spent ages being shown pictures of guys with long flowing styles. Then I pointed out that the sides and back were shaved. Basically the only way forward was to go for a crew cut. Next I was told that I had terrible split ends. They were going to wash my hair and put special stuff on it to repair them. I pointed out that only the ends were damaged and they were going to cut it down to a quarter inch long. By now the woman was getting a little annoyed. She just grabbed my hair and pulled it into a ponytail on top of my head an cut the lot off with one snip.

Three-day hen weekends, maybe, or gym equipment filmy with the sweat of strangers. For me, funnily enough, it’s a fashion thing. What I never, ever want to go back to is carrying an overspill bag.

For years I was a committed overspill bag woman. You know the type – wallet, phone and lip balm in her smart handbag or crossbody bag but with a lumpy tote bag slung over one shoulder. This bag might contain, say, my gym trainers and a garden trowel I needed to return to a friend, or a book I was determined to finish before book club and a plastic tub of last night’s risotto to eat at my desk while finishing said book in a 15-minute microlunch break.

Your hybrid handbag needs a certain gravitas. It should help you feel your schedule is under control

When I worked only from home, I didn’t need an overspill bag. I barely needed a handbag. Now I am back in the office some of the time, I am unwilling to go back to spending every commute looking like my luggage broke on the way back from a weekend minibreak. I want to at least aim for balance – and saying goodbye to a cheap, uncomfortable bag that gives me back pain is a start.

In the era of hybrid working, what is the perfect hybrid handbag? I’m backing a structured tote. Something roomy, but soft and lightweight. This is where you’re thinking: OK, that’s fine, I’ve got loads of fabric tote bags stuffed in the kitchen drawer …

Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind the scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.

I’m sorry to tell you that’s not what I’m talking about. Those floppy fabric things? Nope. That’s a tote, but it’s not the answer to your hybrid prayers. Your hybrid handbag needs a certain gravitas. It should help you feel like your day is manageable and your schedule is under control. Leather or what the youngsters call “vegan leather” (fake leather to oldies) is good.

The Telfar Tote, otherwise known as the Brooklyn Birkin, gets a lot of eye-roll reaction by those who think it’s too-cool-for-school hype, but in its lightweight fabrication, comfortable handles and well-thought-out pockets, it is damn near perfect. Kurt Geiger’s recycled square shopper, made of quilted recycled black nylon, has a pleasingly Prada-adjacent vibe for a fraction of the cost.

You don’t want lots of bells and whistles, but a few punctuating details – a little hardware, perhaps where the straps join the bag, like on All Saints’ Edbury shoulder bag – is good. Boden and Jigsaw are good labels to try. Rather than shell out for a logo, think about investing in your own initials. There are excellent monogrammed leather totes to be had on Etsy.

I don’t have a label snob bone in my body, but a strap that breaks can derail a whole day and a bag that has been thought through – comfortable straps, secure inner pockets – is essential. Preloved is a no-brainer. That gorgeous, porridgy leather that Mulberry uses looks more refined the older it gets – the Dorset tote, with postman’s lock for security, is worth stalking on Vestiaire Collective or wherever you get your preloved fashion.

The right bag is simple, really. It should feel as natural to pick up on days when you leave the kitchen table only to pop out for a pint of milk as it does in the meeting room when you swing by the office. It should help you feel properly dressed in a restaurant and be comfortable enough that you can walk home, shoes permitting. It should do everything – without trying to do everything all at once.

As is buying outfits that don't have pockets. The distinction between a bag for your wallet/ phone ( see : pockets ) and a bag for other bigger things was figured out by 99.99% of people after the first time they used two bags and had a sore back as a result.

Yes, they have them. People use backpacks for a reason : they work. Yes, they can be fashionable. No, they won't spoil your outfit. No, you won't look like a French exchange student with one. Yes, they look a darn sight better than shoulder tote with all you stuff sticking out of them, and poking people in the face when you pass them. But remember kids, take off your backpack when you're on public transport. It's polite."," Sorry, but you need the 'overspill' bag: the crucial valuable stuff is in the across the body bag because you want to keep your keys/wallet/diary/notebook/mobile phone safe and about you - the 'overspill bag' is for the wet umbrella (yes, wrapped in a carrier bag first), the water bottle, that item you've just gotten from the shop but don't - for godsake - want to actually put into a nice handbag!! And, yes, the 'overspill bag' has to be a canvas tote: so you can wash it, because you know you need to, to keep it hygienic given all the type of stuff you put in it and the constant handling of it."," Some backpack cons: It can make your skirt/dress hike up in the back. It can make your back sweat. The straps hang in your armpits and can get gross quickly if you're sweating a lot in tank tops. Some stores require you to check them at the counter. Stiff jackets (I'm thinking harder suede or satin) don't always sit well under backpack straps. About 80% of the time it's still my first choice, but I think it works best in rotation. When it's really hot I don't want something that sits on my body. If I don't need to carry a lot of things, a fanny pack is better and can be worn on my waist or cross body. I also like big totes with small handles, almost grocery bag style, that I can carry in my hands instead of putting strain on my shoulders. Combined with the fanny pack, I guess that's overspill, but you're still only one hand down. Plus, in my experience, transferring my things from one bag to the other forces me to clean them from clutter more often, which makes them more functional."," I love handbags and shoulder bags yet almost never use one; that’s because I use a back-pack. I have several quite stylish ones to match the clothes I usually wear, both dressy and sporty. I doubt I’ll ever go back to ordinary bags, it’s so much easier have hands free.", What pisses me off about a lot of these bags is the lack of a proper zip fastening (like the telfar one you recommend).

Also could we please have pics in these articles? It's annoying to have to click on links just to see whats being discussed," I suppose fashionistas wouldn't even consider wearing a backpack. Something that is practical and does not incur suffering by wearing it just doesn't fit the requirements somehow. Although that attitude could be changed easily.

Saddle leather backpack with no brand, only 'Made in Italy'. Internal and external pockets, big enough for giant textbooks or as an overnight bag, small enough to be practical, people complimented it all the time, only cost me $15. It was pretty shagged when I bought it, and after 12 years of use was missing load-bearing rivets, various fittings, and a hole big enough for coins to fall out of had worn through the bottom. Was bereft. But found manufacterer in Italy on etsy, and bought an exact replica, this time in dark red. Looks good for at least another 15 years."," I ditched back packs a decade ago.

I am likely never getting rid of a tote. I have tried to use the tote as an all in one as many of my totes have a zipper inner pocket or an unzipped inner pocket; however, I can be irresponsible and leave my tote on the ground or in a dressing room, so for me, it's a security issue. Once I took a grocery store tote, not my usual study one, on a walk. Unbeknownst to me, it had a small hole in the corner that expanded as I walked.

Priced at £60, it was a thick, sturdy leather tote in camel brown, and absolutely massive. It has an open inside main compartment (not lined in black...why is that a thing, by the way?) with a single zip close pocket that easily fits the phone and keys. I leave the house with a purse, a bottle of water and small make-up bag with essentials and still have loads of room to throw in whatever else gets picked up along the way. That one lasted 12 years before I accidentally broke some eggs inside of it. I panicked and ran to the FF website only to find they didn't do that style anymore. So off to eBay I went. I now have 3 on stand-by in almost-new condition. The leather is incredible, ages so nicely and the simple, proper tote shape is just classic. The thick and wide handles are long enough for the shoulder, but not too long; I can carry it at the side without dragging on the ground. I take it everywhere. I use it for everything. I have no other handbags in my life. And don't plan to, obviously. If anyone is looking for a huge, really thick leather tote...set up a search alert on eBay for the Fat Face one.

It's deceptively spacious - I've shoved cameras, jackets, books, lunch, whatever into the side zipped compartment. It comes in a variety of colours with a patterned front pocket and also in leather if you want something a little more chic."," Since I retired I have liberated myself from bags and lugging stuff about. What ever I choose to wear usually has pockets and a £20.00 note and my debit card goes in pocket 1 and a folded up thin/strong tote bag in pocket 2 just in case I decide to do buy something. Weekly or even fortnightly food shopping is easy, eco friendly bags live in the car boot, every thing I buy goes in the trolley and is unloaded into the bags in the car boot. I don't even take a phone out with every time I go any where, I don't need to be in constant touch and available to people, however much I care about them. The lack of back ache is a plus, but the feeling of liberation from lugging weighty stuff is a real bonus.

Edith, London

Don't be ridiculous, Edith. Obviously going out in your pyjamas is not being encouraged by the fashion industry because most people already have a pair of pyjamas. Thus, you would not need to buy anything and what would be the point of advocating a fashion trend that does not involve expenditure of some kind on the part of the customer? That would be airlines promoting holiday destinations to which you can drive.

So no, this pyjamas trend of which you hear speak does not mean your five-year-old cotton pyjamas that your Auntie Mavis gave you for Christmas, but rather swanky, matching and highly patterned trousers and button-down tops. If the response you just made to the aforementioned sentence went something like ""Ah … of course … I see … Eh?"", you would not be alone.

You see, this ""pyjamas"" malarkey is basically this season's tribal trend, in the sense that it involves highly patterned clothes that magazine editors love because they liven up a page and most sentient humans wouldn't let within a 20m radius of their person. Hey, I get that there are only so many ways to skin a cat and designers have to come up with something new from time to time to make people get their wallets out. After all, the other big trends of the season are pastel and 1920s and the truth is, most women already have something pastel and something they could claim is flapper-esque (with a bit of zhuzhing up with a judiciously placed feathered headband, say) in their wardrobes, so the fashion industry needs to proffer the folk something that they actually need to buy.

But the reason most women don't have floral trouser suits at home is because they don't want to look like an acid flashback. When I see all of those images of women in head-to-toe floral trouser suits on magazine spreads, I don't think, ""Wow! Florals but, like, in such a modern, non-girly way"", I think, ""Whoa, where's the Vita Sackville-West tea party, eh?""

The only women who could ever rock a floral trouser suit with dignity were The Golden Girls, and while none can surpass me in my love for The Golden Girls, I don't particularly want to look like them. Well, not quite yet, anyways. Talk like them, live in a house in Miami like them and hang out with Leslie Nielsen as they do – that's another story.

I recently went to a certain high-street store to check out its collaboration with a high-end designer. Before I knew what was going on, I spent about £200 on a load of stuff I don't even like. How can I stop myself from getting so carried away next time?

Ellen, by email

Yes, tricky this, Ellen, and I think you and I might have gone to the same sale, even. Shall we say it? Oh go on – let's go crazy: the Marni for H&M sale.

They really have a good thing going with these designer collaborations, the high-street stores. Aside from the bonus of getting in a designer whose name they can slap all over the clothes, the press builds up the sales with so much hype that by the time you actually get in the store to buy the clothes, even hardened fashion hacks – truly, I've been in the trenches of Milan fashion week – can get a bit carried away. So it was at the Marni for H&M sale last week.

There I was queueing up outside, a mere hour and a quarter before the store opened, which I personally think was pretty bleeding restrained, all things considered. You see, I'd seen in magazines that there was a particular jacket among the collection. A blue jacket. One I had been dreaming of for literally a decade ever since Marni included it in its mainline collection which, unfortunately, is a touch beyond my means. But now I could have it on the cheap! There is a God after all – take that Richard Dawkins! You can't argue with a blue jacket!

At last, we got into the store and I ran, in Chariots of Fire-style slo-mo with accompanying music, and I got my jacket. Hurrah! But somewhere in between the jacket rail and the checkout tills I seem to have scooped up about, oh, eight other items, suddenly driven mad by the euphoria of the whole thing. Reader, I bought them. So now I have my jacket, yes, but I ended up spending about the same as if I'd bought it from Marni itself.

So the answer to your question, Ellen, is quite simple: don't go.",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2012/mar/12/pyjama-trend-go-out-pyjamas#comments," This is a real Londoncentric article.In Liverpool women have been going to the shops in their pyjamas for as long as I can remember, especially anytime before 11 am.", Forgot going out in pyjamas.

I know I'm sounding like the typical begrudging Leftist engaged in politics of envy, but seriously, while I don't begrudge those retail managers and designers spending thousands and going crazy on a Marni-on-the-cheap shopping spree (I may disdain their actual dress sense, but that's another matter); but I seriously can't wrap my head around wee young uns' these days having that kind of spending power, dropping half a grand on a fashion shop to be ""on trend"", while some of their peers are struggling to get into third level education even due to the sheer costs of College fees.

I thought I was over all that - the palpitations, the tug of lust across a crowded room but it turns out I'm not. My pulse quickens and my palms sweat as I fight my way across to the objects of my desire – in the Miu Miu section of Selfridges shoe hall. Oh my word! The sinuous curve of the heel! The inky darkness of the suede! The saucy little zip at the back! And, oh horrors, the price tag… Hush, can you hear that? That's my middle-aged common sense hitting the floor with a resounding thud. You know how it goes – the internal argument between good intentions and running for the cash register, booty in one hand and the credit card in the other. It'll be fine, you tell yourself, and it is, until the bill arrives and then it's a diet of self-recrimination, guilt and Pot Noodle for a month. It's shoes that are my Achilles heel, in a manner of speaking.

I've always had a thing for shoes (and bowls, books, jugs, rings, old linen, cats and ice cream). I've written about shoes before and barely scratched the surface because there's just so much still to be written. To me shoes are works of art and I could, if I wished, write entire books about them. They are covetable, stroke-able, cherish-able, delicious pieces of design. I adore the curve of an instep, the arch of a foot, the hourglass shape of a Louis heel. Where shoes are concerned I have no will power – I have the backbone of a sonambulant squid.

I'm not alone in this obsession. It's a well-trodden path, if you'll forgive the pun, but I do wonder if I'm in the minority for not having the wearing of beautiful shoes as the principal reason for buying them? I'm quite happy to sit and gaze at them, as I would a painting in the National Gallery, and I leave a different pair out of their box every week so that I can look at and enjoy them. Think of the love and pride with which Sean Bean described Tracie's (size 10) Italian made custom stitched heels in Jimmy McGovern's Accused the other week and you might begin to understand. I'll happily potter about at home in favourite shoes and sometimes I'll wear them for special occasions but I don't want to wear them out by wearing them OUT – it's a pair of flip-flops and a quick pause in a shop doorway or on the bus to change shoes. To be honest with you I've reached the age where I'm not prepared to put up with plantar fasciitis for the sake of the look of the thing anyway and it never ceases to amaze me that, however comfortable a pair of shoes are at home, by the time you've been standing for 10 minutes with a glass of wine in one hand and a mini-burger in the other your feet are on fire and you spend the rest of the evening looking for somewhere to take the weight off. In my recent partying past I've been known to take my shoes off partway through the evening and carry them around like a handbag – the problem with this is that I'm not very tall and disappear below canapé height without a 6"" heel. Besides, the look is a bit flower-child-with-a-bus-pass.

Anyway, I love and need designer shoes but I don't have that many really, mostly because I also need to eat and put a roof over my head. I also think (and I'm sure there'll be howls of protest at this) that once you're past a certain age/weight/physical shape some shoes just look wrong, like you're trying too hard. Still nothing will wean me off the shoes that can make or break an outfit, your hip, your bank balance and your heart.

Follow The Invisible Woman on Twitter @TheVintageYear",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2012/aug/29/i-love-high-heels#comments," My mother's told me a story of how, in about 1949, she lived in the Lebanon where my father was working as a pilot.  Following the war shoes were rationed in the UK, but she found a local shoemaker and was able to buy as many pairs as she wanted.  Apparently he could reproduce her designs to the last doodle, which would be embroidered into the leather. Shortly after her return to England my parents had guests.  My mother was telling them about the shoes she had bought and my dad said to the women, 'Just help yourself to some of them, she has loads'.  Of course they did.  When she told me this story 30 years later you could still feel her anger. Only one pair survived to my adolescence.  They are emerald green sandals, 4 inch heels, small platforms, soft draped suede and tied at the ankles.  My mum was a size bigger than me but I wore them until they lost their structural integrity and they remained in her wardrobe until the day she died.  I believe a niece has them now.  If I had my way they would be in a frame on my wall...."," Call me a scare-mongerer but I've always believed you should be able to make a run for it in the shoes you're wearing. From dogs/scary people/ plagues of locusts - delete as appropriate. If you can do that in Louboutins, then I salute you.", You are gloriously right in buying a pair of shoes that inspire you to write with such abandon about the joy they give you ! If it wasn't for a serious injury I'd be in Selfridges trying them on right now . Hope your joy lasts a very long time. It always amazes me how some people find it perfectly acceptable to spend vast sums of money on obsolescent technology and think  nothing of spending hundreds of pounds on an I phone for a teenager yest shriek in horror when a grown woman pays for her own well deserved treat. ( yes of course fashion is obsolescent too but in 10 years time your shoes will still WORK ). You made my day.," Not a matter of looking wrong, or of age.  It's just a matter of priorities.  I've always had ""bad feet"", in the sense that the most minor of defects or deficiencies in a shoe will hurt them in minutes.  When I was (very, very much) younger, I'd try to persevere with shoes, once I'd spent money on them.  However I finally figured out that I was not spending enough on them, and was buying cheap shoes because I liked the way they looked.  Since I need my feet for running ( a very high priority, far above being in fashion), I decided to preserve them and have only one rule about shoes: I must be able to walk in them. And not just across the floor with a glass of wine in my hand - blocks.  Even miles. Interestingly enough, there are actually designer shoes that can be walked in.  There may even be designer shoes with 3-inch heels that can be walked in - just not by my feet.  But if you can do it, I say go ahead and rock the high heels, regardless of your age. On the other hand, if you're tottering about with quivering ankles and reeling from pain, that's not a good look at any age. BTW, it's ""principal""."," ...my dad said to the women, 'Just help yourself to some of them, she has loads'. Of course they did. When she told me this story 30 years later you could still feel her anger. Right up there with dad giving my collection of Biba outfits away - I twitch every time I think about it. Apart from the giving-away bit this is a lovely story. I love your description of the Emerald Slippers."," I'm still fairly young, but I don't buy shoes if I can't walk comfortably in them. This means walking back and forth in store aisles for several minutes, analyzing every possible point of pain, while the shop assistants watch, bemused. I don't have much of a budget so I tend to buy cheap flats, but I can wear them to the office, to the grocery store, on a three-mile walk to my apartment from the grocery store (I have to get exercise somehow!), on dates, etc. I have exactly two pairs of heels. One pair is a fairly plain and comfortable pair of black 'court shoes' with a small platform, padded insides and three-inch heels (I have large feet, so three-inch heels aren't too severe). These shoes stay in my desk at the office and rarely touch a surface other than carpet. The other pair looks identical, except the outsides are cork. (Yes, like a wine bottle's cork.) They are beautiful - neutral and capable of 'going with' anything, but more unusual than your standard nude or brown heel. I have never had an occasion to wear these."," I've always worn sensible shoes (doc martens, birkenstocks, duck feet, rocket dogs) because I want to be able to walk in my shoes without pain. A friend commented recently on how pretty my feet were. I guess that soft skin, no bunions or corns, no veiny or rough skin is what you get when you wear proper shoes all of your life. The backs of my heels are smooth, and I have been blister-free ever since I was a girl guide and I wore a pair of hiking boots for too long on the first day."," A few observations, purely personal / subjective (before anyone gets on their on high heels, sorry, horse): 1) I cannot believe women tottering around in ridiculously high shoes, looking like trainee drag queens, is attractive to men. 2) Painful shoes = frowning = Botox. 3) Ill-fitting shoes = corns and bunions. It's a bit like the Brighid Jones' magic pants dilemma ... you look good while they're on, but what happens when you get better acquainted? 4) That ""clack clack"" noise, especially on laminate flooring, is the trotter equivalent of loudly chewing gum with your mouth open. There, I've said it!"," Just as I thought that I had no more shoes to buy I rather reluctantly but now enthusiastically (it turns out) took up Ceroc dancing.  Dancing shoes are light, slightly too glitzy for any other purpose and have ""hushed tones"" suede soles - yay! I'm only on week seven of said dancing and have two pairs already yip yip yipeee"," I`ve come to realise there are three types of shoes namely walking shoes, standing shoes and sitting shoes. Need to have most of the first cathegory. End of story about me and shoes. Relief, so many other hang-ups."," Can't wear high heels anymore due to arthritis and issues with the front of my feet, but one can find zillions of comfortable shoes that look great. On a recent shopping trip to London, I came home with 1 pair of Crocs in leopard with open toes and one pair of Crocs that change color in the sunlight as well as a pair of Converse All- Stars in leopard. I love to dance and to ride a bicycle and I always have bought shoes that I could do both in. I don't want to waste time having sore feet."," I like the look of some heels, in theory - although I've always found a lot of the designer ones quite ugly. But as I have a slipped disc in my lower back, actually wearing the things is agony, and although you'd think flats would be better, they aren't, because they provide no support. I very much wish that it was possible to find shoes which have a low, manageable heel (say 1"") that also manage to look nice. Unfortunately, this is where the ""low-heeled court shoe"" rears its hideous head..."," Shoes you can walk in ???? whatever next.  My footwear falls into two main categories, shoes that are almost impossibly painful to walk in and shoes that don't hurt quite so much. Honestly I once wore a pair of wellingtons (skull and rose design but of course) and have seriously never felt such pain in my life. Despite my advancing years I've yet to learn that falling in love with a shoe at first sight doesn't equate at all to having  pain free relationship with it. In  fact I swear some shoes are specially progammed to lull you into a false sense of comfort when you try them only to become the foot equivalent of a velociraptor when you have bought them. Designer, high street or my favourite...vintage (bought on the theory that someone else has done the pain so I can have the gain) - like the love of hopeless men, my love of hopeless shoes is something I suspect I will never get over"," My mother has a shoe / clothing / handbag shopping addiction that has run up serious debt.  On top of that, she has horrific bunions and her feet are now in a permanent pointy toe shape. Nevertheless, the shoes keep coming, and they all look rather ugly because the feet are ugly and deformed in the first place. She endures considerable pain getting about and looks pretty ridiculous when tottering around. I've never been able to understand this slavery to shoes.  Needless to say, my first ever teenage act of rebellion was to choose a pair of loafers for school shoes and wear them until they fell apart. As the years have gone on I've added ""going barefoot as much as possible"" and ""wearing sensible walking boots""  to my offences.I do a lot of sport and need to feel comfortable and injury-free. The skill of designing endless permutations of those little bits of leather and fabric that it takes to clothe the human foot is really something to marvel at, but I'm rather too good at marvelling and then walking away (my cash safely in my purse)."," Heels do make you look better, and it's not necessarily about the actual shoe - it gives the appearance of longer legs and a more upright posture. I look thinner and taller with heels on and it's a good confidence boost. I'd never wear them every day or wear a pair of 5-pound primark shoes that are going to hurt and never stay on - but a nice pair of wedges or high-heeled boots gives you poise and attitude. X"," Time was when we used to dress formally for work and that meant wearing heels.  This was good for me as my legs are my best feature and I just happen to be a shoe freak.  But things change over time and the client I am with at the moment, in one of the more fashionable parts of London, has a serious dress down policy best described in a single word - denim.  Of all the women I encounter during my working day only one wears mid-heels with any regularity; the rest are in flats.  Even the auditors, from one of the most traditional of practices, toe the line (sorry) on our premises.  And so as a consultant/contractor, I feel it behoves me to fit in, too.  Fortunately, I share the ballet-flat mania and have yet to tire of it but I do miss the heels that I now only wear when going out in the evening."," Indeed. I remember a magazine article from way back when I was a kid, about being a ""sensuous woman"". (It must have been right after that book The Sensuous Woman came out).  There was a questionnaire and one of the questions was ""could you run in what you are wearing right now?"".  That is the only question I can remember, in fact that's the only thing I remember about the whole article.  For some reason that question became embedded in my head and even though I'm not walking around trying to be a ""sensuous woman"" (I cannot even recall what that was supposed to mean and I was too young to read the book), I do often find myself reflecting on whether I can run in what I am wearing, and about 99% of the time the answer is ""yes"".  And it's not a frivolous question - at the very least, we have to run for a bus or to catch up to someone once in a while."," I've recently cleared out my wardrobe due to redecorating, and found some of my old shoes - and I have worn a pair of vintage-y Mary Janes that I bought about 14 years ago out twice in the past month. I was under the impression my feet have grown unaccustomed to heels, because every time I try a pair on in the stores these days, they fit much like medieval torture instruments - usually feel so uncomfortable that I can't even imagine sitting with them on my feet for any amount of time. And yet, I've had no problem at all wearing those old heels, all the pairs I'd kept felt just fine when I tried them on. So what is going on?", Why do some women and some men obsesses over a form of shoes that perform the same function (restricting women's mobility and making them physically helpless) as ancient Chinese foot binding? Discuss. Why would anyone choose to wear shoes that hurt them? Discuss again.," Shoes, meh.  Perhaps I should check myself into the Charing Cross Hospital for a sex change op.  I just don't get shoes.  Not that I haven't got quite a few pairs, but a) I'm not interested in any shoes that aren't comfortable b) I don't buy any unless they go with clothes I've got , and most importantly, c) I don't think I've ever been reduced to palpitating, fainting ecstasy over a pair of shoes."," Shoes are sculpture to me.  I love handmade shoes and I don't buy often but they last a long time (especially when sitting in a wheelchair).  I started buying really good shoes when I was working outside jobs to support my art career (mid30s) for a birthday gift to myself.  One year, when newly single again, my friends gave me cash gifts so I could get a pair of shoes I still wear, from Henri Bendels: a low boot-like, short laceup, black soft leather, Italian hand crafted, medium leather stacked heel, with a sky blue trim, very narrow around the top (just under ankle).  I never liked high heels.  The closest I came to height was wearing (only twice- I fell), were platforms in the 1970s.  You're never too old to love shoes.  So much has changed since my grandmothers' days."," a sonambulant squid In the Guardian, can the offspring of squid walk?

Since then I have developed feet issues which prohibit them ever being worn again (by me).  My quandary is should I keep them so I can wear them one last time as part of my ""final departure outfit"" or should I flog them on e-bay!!"," Of course you should keep them!!! Don't get buried in them though, leave them to your daughter (or a granddaughter) or failing that, if they are a size 5, leave them to me :) Hopefully you will have many years of gazing at them in your wardrobe before this decision has to be made..."," Lace up boot type platform heels are the answer! I bought a pair that are impressively high and at a pinch I can run for bus in them. Support for the foot seems to be the key. Can anyone help with the Autumn/winter problem I face every year? During the summer I wear various different coloured pairs of strappy wedges that seem to be right with every outfit. What is the cold weather equivalent? Ankle boots can work but some sort of actual shoe would be a wonderful alternative. What winter footwear will look good with most outfits: jeans, trousers,shorter skirts, longer skirts, dresses etc. How do others manage this?"," I can't tell you how many pairs of shoes (of different heights) I've donated to Oxfam after a couple of wears, before discovering I had wider-than-average feet. Only an E fitting, rather than the standard D, but the difference in comfort is amazing. Totally agree with the person who said the degree of foot coverage / support on top is important too. And I'm not plugging them (never tried them), but M&amp;S have a high-heel range called Insolia, which they claim to be comfortable for 3x as long."," Can't understand the appeal of heels: but then I've never been able to walk in the bloody things (painful and I ALWAYS twist my ankle, whether I am two or six inches off the ground).

(But this IS the Guardian...)"," Totally with you on the 'shoes as art' rather than clothing. I have bought several pairs of shoes over the years purely to have them to admire with no thought of actually wearing them. Almost by definition such shoes are going to be inpractical - on the rare occasions when I have to dress up (I work from home), there's nearly always a walk / bike ride involved in getting to wherever thus raising the practicality stakes - so I never try to deceive myself into buying them 'for work' or  ''to go with that new dress' etc. They're like the paintings I buy for the walls - purely for pleasure. Besides I don't like hurting my feet so very rarely wear 'a heel' as a fashionista would understand it."," I've always worn sensible shoes (doc martens, birkenstocks, duck feet, rocket dogs) because I want to be able to walk in my shoes without pain.

I'm a slave to my gender pre-conditioning."," What winter footwear will look good with most outfits: jeans, trousers,shorter skirts, longer skirts, dresses etc I incline towards some sort of boot in winter. Either a variation on a classic long riding boot (with some room in the leg) or something like an army boot, but not laced right to the top. I avoid ankle boots with a skirt unless I'm wearing matching opaque tights, otherwise they shorten my leg and I'm short enough already!"," I never got the shoe thing. My mother was a great believer in 'a black pencil skirt and black high heels', but I wore moccasins, desert boots and jesus sandals (it was the 1970s). And I would never buy anything that wasn't comfortable in the shop! No 'wearing them in' for me. But I definitely wasn't unusual - all my friends regarded shoeshopping as entering the 7th layer of hell. . . However, I don't even get the pay-off!  My feet seem to have got bigger, and shoes have definitely got less comfortable - why else is there a whole industry selling cushioned insoles?  And I have permanent corns and pain - I only feel comfortable in crocs! I think I need to see a podiatrist - for a long-term relationship - GSOH necessary. And I still hate shopping for shoes!"," I like 'slouchy' boots - they look good with a longer length skirt, and jeggings can be fitted inside!"," I've always worn sensible shoes (doc martens, birkenstocks, duck feet, rocket dogs) because I want to be able to walk in my shoes without pain. Unfortunately, all of the ""sensible"" shoes you name here are made for wider feet than mine and, as buying a size smaller than required in order to get a narrower fit is out of the question, I have given up buying them as they all give me blisters and cramps from trying to hold onto the shoe as it falls from my foot. I love high heels, hate ballerinas (as they are just flat with no structure and so are like walking on cardboard) and believe a shoe should be chosen for usage. If I intend to go walking, I wear a walking boot or a comfortable shoe or sandal, depending on the weather. If I'm off to a nice party, my favourite heels. BTW, I also have very soft feet, with no bunions and they still have their original shape, so it may be that your lovely feet are just genetic..."," I have to wear socks of some type or I get blisters, except with sandals of very, very soft leather.  Even if I am wearing that type of shoes, if I'm going to wear them walking for a whole day, for example, I may still get a blister.  Then I put an ointment on the tender spot.  In the US there is one called ""Aquaphor"", which is similar to a petroleum jelly, but there is also something made by a bandage company that prevents blisters.  Prevention better than the cure, I believe",empty,empty,empty,empty,empty,empty,empty,empty,empty,empty,empty,empty,empty,empty,empty,empty,empty,empty,empty,empty,1,0,0,-1,1,2,2,0,0,2,2,-1,2,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,2,1,2,0,2,-1,1,0,3,-1,1,0,1,-1,0,-1,2,1,0,-1,0,-1,0,-1,0,-1,1,0,0,0,2,0,1,1,0,-1,1,0,1,-1,0,-1,0,-1,0,1,0,1,0,-1,2,1,1,0,-1,0,0,0,0,-1,1,0,3,-1,0,1,1,0,1,-1,1,0,2,0,2,0,-1,0,-1,0,-1,0,-1,0,-1,0,-1,0,-1,0,-1,0,-1,0,-1,0,-1,0,-1,0,-1,0,-1,0,-1,0,-1,0,-1,0,-1,0,-1,0,-1,0
